Optimizing Medical Data Quality Based on Multiagent Web Service Framework;https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2012.2195498;"One of the most important issues in e-healthcare information systems is to optimize the medical data quality extracted from distributed and heterogeneous environments, which can extremely improve diagnostic and treatment decision making. This paper proposes a multiagent web service framework based on service-oriented architecture for the optimization of medical data quality in the e-healthcare information system. Based on the design of the multiagent web service framework, an evolutionary algorithm (EA) for the dynamic optimization of the medical data quality is proposed. The framework consists of two main components; first, an EA will be used to dynamically optimize the composition of medical processes into optimal task sequence according to specific quality attributes. Second, a multiagent framework will be proposed to discover, monitor, and report any inconstancy between the optimized task sequence and the actual medical records. To demonstrate the proposed framework, experimental results for a breast cancer case study are provided. Furthermore, to show the unique performance of our algorithm, a comparison with other works in the literature review will be presented.";1;1;0
An assessment of data quality in a multi-site electronic medical record system in Haiti;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2015.11.003;"Objectives: Strong data quality (DQ) is a precursor to strong data use. In resource limited settings, routine DQ assessment (DQA) within electronic medical record (EMR) systems can be resource-intensive using manual methods such as audit and chart review; automated queries offer an efficient alternative. This DQA focused on Haiti's national EMR - iSant� - and included longitudinal data for over 100,000 persons living with HIV (PLHIV) enrolled in HIV care and treatment services at 95 health care facilities (HCF).

Methods: This mixed-methods evaluation used a qualitative Delphi process to identify DQ priorities among local stakeholders, followed by a quantitative DQA on these priority areas. The quantitative DQA examined 13 indicators of completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of retrospective data collected from 2005 to 2013. We described levels of DQ for each indicator over time, and examined the consistency of within-HCF performance and associations between DQ and HCF and EMR system characteristics.

Results: Over all iSant data, age was incomplete in <1% of cases, while height, pregnancy status, TB status, and ART eligibility were more incomplete (approximately 20-40%). Suspicious data flags were present for <3% of cases of male sex, ART dispenses, CD4 values, and visit dates, but for 26% of cases of age. Discontinuation forms were available for about half of all patients without visits for 180 or more days, and >60% of encounter forms were entered late. For most indicators, DQ tended to improve over time. DQ was highly variable across HCF, and within HCFs DQ was variable across indicators. In adjusted analyses, HCF and system factors with generally favorable and statistically significant associations with DQ were University hospital category, private sector governance, presence of local iSante server, greater HCF experience with the EMR, greater maturity of the EMR itself, and having more system users but fewer new users. In qualitative feedback, local stakeholders emphasized lack of stable power supply as a key challenge to data quality and use of the iSant EMR.

Conclusions: Variable performance on key DQ indicators across HCF suggests that excellent DQ is achievable in Haiti, but further effort is needed to systematize and routinize DQ approaches within HCFs. A dynamic, interactive ""DQ dashboard"" within iSant� could bring transparency and motivate improvement. While the results of the study are specific to Haiti's iSant data system, the study's methods and thematic lessons learned holdgeneralized relevance for other large-scale EMR systems in resource-limited countries.

An importance-performance analysis of hospital information system attributes: A nurses' perspective;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2015.10.010;"Purpose
Health workers have numerous concerns about hospital IS (HIS) usage. Addressing these concerns requires understanding the system attributes most important to their satisfaction and productivity. Following a recent HIS implementation, our objective was to identify priorities for managerial intervention based on user evaluations of the performance of the HIS attributes as well as the relative importance of these attributes to user satisfaction and productivity outcomes.

Procedures
We collected data along a set of attributes representing system quality, data quality, information quality, and service quality from 154 nurse users. Their quantitative responses were analysed using the partial least squares approach followed by an importance-performance analysis. Qualitative responses were analysed using thematic analysis to triangulate and supplement the quantitative findings.

Main findings
Two system quality attributes (responsiveness and ease of learning), one information quality attribute (detail), one service quality attribute (sufficient support), and three data quality attributes (records complete, accurate and never missing) were identified as high priorities for intervention.

Conclusions
Our application of importance-performance analysis is unique in HIS evaluation and we have illustrated its utility for identifying those system attributes for which underperformance is not acceptable to users and therefore should be high priorities for intervention.";0;1;1
Barriers to using eHealth data for clinical performance feedback in Malawi: A case study;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2015.07.003;"Introduction: Sub-optimal performance of healthcare providers in low-income countries is a critical and persistent global problem. The use of electronic health information technology (eHealth) in these settings is creating large-scale opportunities to automate performance measurement and provision of feedback to individual healthcare providers, to support clinical learning and behavior change. An electronic medical record system (EMR) deployed in 66 antiretroviral therapy clinics in Malawi collects data that supervisors use to provide quarterly, clinic-level performance feedback. Understanding barriers to provision of eHealth-based performance feedback for individual healthcare providers in this setting could present a relatively low-cost opportunity to significantly improve the quality of care.

Objective: The aims of this study were to identify and describe barriers to using EMR data for individualized audit and feedback for healthcare providers in Malawi and to consider how to design technology to overcome these barriers.

Methods: We conducted a qualitative study using interviews, observations, and informant feedback in eight public hospitals in Malawi where an EMR system is used. We interviewed 32 healthcare providers and conducted seven hours of observation of system use.

Results: We identified four key barriers to the use of EMR data for clinical performance feedback: provider rotations, disruptions to care processes, user acceptance of eHealth, and performance indicator lifespan. Each of these factors varied across sites and affected the quality of EMR data that could be used for the purpose of generating performance feedback for individual healthcare providers.

Conclusion: Using routinely collected eHealth data to generate individualized performance feedback shows potential at large-scale for improving clinical performance in low-resource settings. However, technology used for this purpose must accommodate ongoing changes in barriers to eHealth data use. Understanding the clinical setting as a complex adaptive system (CAS) may enable designers of technology to effectively model change processes to mitigate these barriers.

Concept and implementation of a computer-based reminder system to increase completeness in clinical documentation;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2011.02.004;"Purpose: Medical documentation is often incomplete. Missing information may impede or bias analysis of study data and can cause delays. In a single source information system, clinical routine documentation and electronic data capture (EDC) systems are connected in the hospital information system (HIS). In this setting, both clinical routine and research would benefit from a higher rate of complete documentation.

Methods: We designed a HIS-based reminder system which identifies not yet finalized forms and sends reminder e-mails to responsible physicians depending on escalation level. The generic concept to create reminder e-mail messages consists in database queries on not-finalized forms and generation of e-mail messages based on this output via the communication server. We compared completeness of electronic HIS forms before and after introduction of the reminder system three months each.

Results: Completeness increased highly significantly (p<0.0001) for each form type (medical history form 93% (145 of 156 forms) vs 100% (206 forms), stress injection protocol 90% (142 of 157 forms) vs 100% (198 forms) and rest injection protocol 31% (45 of 147 forms) vs 100% (208 forms)). Forty-six reminder e-mails to the responsible study physician and 53 reminder e-mails to the principal investigator were sent to finish 2 medical history forms, 8 stress and 20 rest injection protocols. These 2 medical history forms were completed after 1 and 56 days. The median processing time of the stress injection protocols in the post-implementation phase was 18 days (range from 1 to 60 days). The median processing time of the rest injection protocols was 26 days (range from 5 to 37 days).

Conclusion: A computer-based reminder system to identify incomplete documentation forms with a notification and escalation mechanism can improve completeness of finalized forms significantly. It is technically feasible and effective in the clinical setting.";1;1;0
Does single-source create an added value? Evaluating the impact of introducing x4T into the clinical routine on workflow modifications, data quality and cost-benefit;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2014.08.007;"Objectives: The first objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of integrating a single-source system into the routine patient care documentation workflow with respect to process modifications, data quality and execution times in patient care as well as research documentation. The second one is to evaluate whether it is cost-efficient using a single-source system in terms of achieved savings in documentation expenditures.

Methods: We analyzed the documentation workflow of routine patient care and research documentation in the medical field of pruritus to identify redundant and error-prone process steps. Based on this, we established a novel documentation workflow including the x4T (exchange for Trials) system to connect hospital information systems with electronic data capture systems for the exchange of study data. To evaluate the workflow modifications, we performed a before/after analysis as well as a time-motion study. Data quality was assessed by measuring completeness, correctness and concordance of previously and newly collected data. A cost-benefit analysis was conducted to estimate the savings using x4T per collected data element and the additional costs for introducing x4T.

Results: The documentation workflow of patient care as well as clinical research was modified due to the introduction of the x4T system. After x4T implementation and workflow modifications, half of the redundant and error-prone process steps were eliminated. The generic x4T system allows direct transfer of routinely collected health care data into the x4T research database and avoids manual transcription steps. Since x4T has been introduced in March 2012, the number of included patients has increased by about 1000 per year. The average entire documentation time per patient visit has been significantly decreased by 70.1% (from 1116�185 to 334�83 s). After the introduction of the x4T system and associated workflow changes, the completeness of mandatory data elements raised from 82.2% to 100%. In case of the pruritus research study, the additional costs for introducing the x4T system are 434.01 and the savings are 0.48ct per collected data element. So, with the assumption of a 5-year runtime and 82 collected data elements per patient, the amount of documented patients has to be higher than 1102 to create a benefit.

Conclusion: Introduction of the x4T system into the clinical and research documentation workflow can optimize the data collection workflow in both areas. Redundant and cumbersome process steps can be eliminated in the research documentation, with the result of reduced documentation times as well as increased data quality. The usage of the x4T system is especially worthwhile in a study with a large amount of collected data or a high number of included patients.

mplementation of a cloud-based electronic medical record for maternal and child health in rural Kenya;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2015.01.005;"Background: Complete and timely health information is essential to inform public health decision-making for maternal and child health, but is often lacking in resource-constrained settings. Electronic medical record (EMR) systems are increasingly being adopted to support the delivery of health care, and are particularly amenable to maternal and child health services. An EMR system could enable the mother and child to be tracked and monitored throughout maternity shared care, improve quality and completeness of data collected and enhance sharing of health information between outpatient clinic and the hospital, and between clinical and public health services to inform decision-making.

Methods: This study implemented a novel cloud-based electronic medical record system in a maternal and child health outpatient setting in Western Kenya between April and June 2013 and evaluated its impact on improving completeness of data collected by clinical and public health services. The impact of the system was assessed using a two-sample test of proportions pre- and post-implementation of EMR-based data verification.

Results: Significant improvements in completeness of the antenatal record were recorded through implementation of EMR-based data verification. A difference of 42.9% in missing data (including screening for hypertension, tuberculosis, malaria, HIV status or ART status of HIV positive women) was recorded pre- and post-implementation. Despite significant impact of EMR-based data verification on data completeness, overall screening rates in antenatal care were low.

Conclusion: This study has shown that EMR-based data verification can improve the completeness of data collected in the patient record for maternal and child health. A number of issues, including data management and patient confidentiality, must be considered but significant improvements in data quality are recorded through implementation of this EMR model.

Optimizing the user interface of a data entry module for an electronic patient record for cardiac rehabilitation: A mixed method usability approach;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2015.12.007;"Introduction: Cumbersome electronic patient record (EPR) interfaces may complicate data-entry in clinical practice. Completeness of data entered in the EPR determines, among other things, the value of computerized clinical decision support (CCDS). Quantitative usability evaluations can provide insight into mismatches between the system design model of data entry and users' data entry behavior, but not into the underlying causes for these mismatches. Mixed method usability evaluation studies may provide these insights, and thus support generating redesign recommendations for improving an EPR system's data entry interface.

Aim: To improve the usability of the data entry interface of an EPR system with CCDS in the field of cardiac rehabilitation (CR), and additionally, to assess the value of a mixed method usability approach in this context.

Methods: Seven CR professionals performed a think-aloud usability evaluation both before (beta-version) and after the redesign of the system. Observed usability problems from both evaluations were analyzed and categorized using Zhang et al.'s heuristic principles of good interface design. We combined the think-aloud usability evaluation of the system's beta-version with the measurement of a new usability construct: users' deviations in action sequence from the system's predefined data entry order sequence. Recommendations for redesign were implemented. We assessed whether the redesign improved CR professionals' (1) task efficacy (with respect to the completeness of data they collected), and (2) task efficiency (with respect to the average number of mouse clicks they needed to complete data entry subtasks).

Results: With the system's beta version, 40% of health care professionals' navigation actions through the system deviated from the predefined next system action. The causes for these deviations as revealed by the think-aloud method mostly concerned mismatches between the system design model for data entry action sequences and users expectations of these action sequences, based on their paper-based daily routines. This caused non completion of data entry tasks (31% of main tasks completed), and more navigation actions than minimally required (146% of the minimum required). In the redesigned system the data entry navigational structure was organized in a flexible way around an overview screen to better mimic users' paper-based daily routines of collecting patient data. This redesign resulted in an increased number of completed main tasks (70%) and a decrease in navigation actions (133% of the minimum required). The think-aloud usability evaluation of the redesigned system showed that remaining problems concerned flexibility (e.g., lack of customization options) and consistency (mainly with layout and position of items on the screen).

Conclusion: The mixed method usability evaluation was supportive in revealing the magnitude and causes of mismatches between the system design model of data-entry with users' data entry behavior. However, as both task efficacy and efficiency were still not optimal with the redesigned EPR, we advise to perform a cognitive analysis on end users' mental processes and behavior patterns in daily work processes specifically during the requirements analysis phase of development of interactive healthcare information systems.

Reporting systems, reporting rates and completeness of data reported from primary healthcare to a Swedish quality register--the National Diabetes Register;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2011.06.006;Objective: The aims of this paper were to study the reporting rate and completeness of data reported from primary healthcare centres (PHCCs) in Sweden to the Swedish National Diabetes Register (NDR), with a special attention on the relation between these measures and the reporting system used by the PHCCs. Method: A national survey conducted in Swedish primary healthcare covering the year 2006. A questionnaire was used to collect data from 523 PHCCs. Data on 87,099 adult diabetic patients attending these PHCCs and reported to the NDR were obtained from the register. In Sweden, participation in the NDR is voluntary. The data were reported through the Internet, either online using a web-based system or by direct transmission. The main outcome measures were reporting rate and completeness of reported data. Results: Of the 523 PHCCs, almost two-thirds had reported <75% of their diabetic patients to the NDR. The lowest reporting rate was found among the largest PHCCs, while the highest was found among small PHCCs (p<0.001). Reasons given for not reporting data to the NDR were lack of time and lack of personnel resources. Altogether, 73.1% of the PHCCs reported data to the NDR online using a web-based system, 20.5% used direct transmission and 6.3% used both systems. The PHCCs that reported data through direct transmission systems reported almost 70% of their diabetic patients to the NDR, while PHCCs using web-based systems reported 54% of their diabetic patients to the NDR. Adjusted for other factors, using direct transmission increased the reporting rate by 13.0 percentage points. However, the web-based system contributed to a higher completeness of data than the direct transmission system. Conclusions: A direct transmission system facilitates a high reporting rate to the register at the expense of lower completeness of the reported data.;0;1;0
Structured data quality reports to improve EHR data quality;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2015.09.008;"Objective: To examine whether a structured data quality report (SDQR) and feedback sessions with practice principals and managers improve the quality of routinely collected data in EHRs.

Methods: The intervention was conducted in four general practices participating in the Fairfield neighborhood electronic Practice Based Research Network (ePBRN). Data were extracted from their clinical information systems and summarised as a SDQR to guide feedback to practice principals and managers at 0, 4, 8 and 12 months. Data quality (DQ) metrics included completeness, correctness, consistency and duplication of patient records. Information on data recording practices, data quality improvement, and utility of SDQRs was collected at the feedback sessions at the practices. The main outcome measure was change in the recording of clinical information and level of meeting Royal Australian College of General Practice (RACGP) targets.

Results: Birth date was 100% and gender 99% complete at baseline and maintained. DQ of all variables measured improved significantly (p<0.01) over 12 months, but was not sufficient to comply with RACGP standards. Improvement was greatest with allergies. There was no significant change in duplicate records.

Conclusions: SDQRs and feedback sessions support general practitioners and practice managers to focus on improving the recording of patient information. However, improved practice DQ, was not sufficient to meet RACGP targets. Randomised controlled studies are required to evaluate strategies to improve data quality and any associated improved safety and quality of care.

Structured electronic operative reporting: comparison with dictation in kidney cancer surgery;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2011.11.008;"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the functionality of eKidney as a structured reporting tool in operative note generation. To do this, we compared completeness and timeliness of eKidney template-generated nephrectomy OR notes with standard narrative dictation.

Methods: A group of academic uro-oncologists and medical informaticians at the University Health Network designed and adopted an electronic online, point-of-care clinical documentation tool, eCancerCare(Kidney) (eKidney) for kidney cancer patient care. The optimal components of clinic and operative note templates, including those for nephrectomy, were agreed upon by expert consensus of the uro-oncologists. Clinician nephrectomy OR reports were analyzed for completeness, comparing those generated in eKidney with conventionally dictated notes. Patterns of missing information from both dictated and eKidney-generated reports were analyzed. The procedure, note completion and transcription dates were recorded which generated time intervals between these events. The records of 189 procedures were included in the analysis.

Results: Comparison of clinicians who used both note generation modalities, revealed a mean completion rate of 92% for eKidney/structured notes and 68% for dictated notes (p<0.0001). There was no significant difference in completion rates between attending staff and trainees (residents and fellows) (p=0.131). Most notes were dictated/entered on the day of surgery. Dictated notes were transcribed to EPR a median of 2 days after dictation, however roughly 30% of dictated notes took 5 days or more to get transcribed. All notes generated using eKidney were uploaded to the EPR immediately.

Limitations: Our study has three significant limitations. Firstly, our study was not randomized: physicians could elect to dictate or use eKidney. Secondly, we did not identify data from dictated notes that were not captured by eKidney. Third, we did not compare the time it took physicians to complete the fields in eKidney with the time it takes to dictate a note.

Conclusions: We have demonstrated that the use of structured reporting improves the completeness and timeliness of documentation in kidney cancer surgery. eKidney is an example of the power of templates in ensuring that important details of a procedure are recorded. Future studies looking at user satisfaction, and research and educational potential of eKidney would be valuable.";0;1;0
Towards an ontology for data quality in integrated chronic disease management: a realist review of the literature;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2012.10.001;"Purpose: Effective use of routine data to support integrated chronic disease management (CDM) and population health is dependent on underlying data quality (DQ) and, for cross system use of data, semantic interoperability. An ontological approach to DQ is a potential solution but research in this area is limited and fragmented.

Objective: Identify mechanisms, including ontologies, to manage DQ in integrated CDM and whether improved DQ will better measure health outcomes.

Methods: A realist review of English language studies (January 2001-March 2011) which addressed data quality, used ontology-based approaches and is relevant to CDM.

Results: We screened 245 papers, excluded 26 duplicates, 135 on abstract review and 31 on full-text review; leaving 61 papers for critical appraisal. Of the 33 papers that examined ontologies in chronic disease management, 13 defined data quality and 15 used ontologies for DQ. Most saw DQ as a multidimensional construct, the most used dimensions being completeness, accuracy, correctness, consistency and timeliness. The majority of studies reported tool design and development (80%), implementation (23%), and descriptive evaluations (15%). Ontological approaches were used to address semantic interoperability, decision support, flexibility of information management and integration/linkage, and complexity of information models.

Conclusion: DQ lacks a consensus conceptual framework and definition. DQ and ontological research is relatively immature with little rigorous evaluation studies published. Ontology-based applications could support automated processes to address DQ and semantic interoperability in repositories of routinely collected data to deliver integrated CDM. We advocate moving to ontology-based design of information systems to enable more reliable use of routine data to measure health mechanisms and impacts.";0;0;1
Validating an ontology-based algorithm to identify patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in electronic health records;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2014.06.002;"Background: Improving healthcare for people with chronic conditions requires clinical information systems that support integrated care and information exchange, emphasizing a semantic approach to support multiple and disparate Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Using a literature review, the Australian National Guidelines for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), SNOMED-CT-AU and input from health professionals, we developed a Diabetes Mellitus Ontology (DMO) to diagnose and manage patients with diabetes. This paper describes the manual validation of the DMO-based approach using real world EHR data from a general practice (n=908 active patients) participating in the electronic Practice Based Research Network (ePBRN).

Method: The DMO-based algorithm to query, using Semantic Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL), the structured fields in the ePBRN data repository were iteratively tested and refined. The accuracy of the final DMO-based algorithm was validated with a manual audit of the general practice EHR. Contingency tables were prepared and Sensitivity and Specificity (accuracy) of the algorithm to diagnose T2DM measured, using the T2DM cases found by manual EHR audit as the gold standard. Accuracy was determined with three attributes - reason for visit (RFV), medication (Rx) and pathology (path) - singly and in combination.

Results: The Sensitivity and Specificity of the algorithm were 100% and 99.88% with RFV; 96.55% and 98.97% with Rx; and 15.6% and 98.92% with Path. This suggests that Rx and Path data were not as complete or correct as the RFV for this general practice, which kept its RFV information complete and current for diabetes. However, the completeness is good enough for this purpose as confirmed by the very small relative deterioration of the accuracy (Sensitivity and Specificity of 97.67% and 99.18%) when calculated for the combination of RFV, Rx and Path. The manual EHR audit suggested that the accuracy of the algorithm was influenced by data quality such as incorrect data due to mistaken units of measurement and unavailable data due to non-documentation or documented in the wrong place or progress notes, problems with data extraction, encryption and data management errors.

Conclusion: This DMO-based algorithm is sufficiently accurate to support a semantic approach, using the RFV, Rx and Path to define patients with T2DM from EHR data. However, the accuracy can be compromised by incomplete or incorrect data. The extent of compromise requires further study, using ontology-based and other approaches.

HIS-based Kaplan-Meier plots--a single source approach for documenting and reusing routine survival information;https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6947-11-11;"Background: Survival or outcome information is important for clinical routine as well as for clinical research and should be collected completely, timely and precisely. This information is relevant for multiple usages including quality control, clinical trials, observational studies and epidemiological registries. However, the local hospital information system (HIS) does not support this documentation and therefore this data has to generated by paper based or spreadsheet methods which can result in redundantly documented data. Therefore we investigated, whether integrating the follow-up documentation of different departments in the HIS and reusing it for survival analysis can enable the physician to obtain survival curves in a timely manner and to avoid redundant documentation.

Methods: We analysed the current follow-up process of oncological patients in two departments (urology, haematology) with respect to different documentation forms. We developed a concept for comprehensive survival documentation based on a generic data model and implemented a follow-up form within the HIS of the University Hospital Muenster which is suitable for a secondary use of these data. We designed a query to extract the relevant data from the HIS and implemented Kaplan-Meier plots based on these data. To re-use this data sufficient data quality is needed. We measured completeness of forms with respect to all tumour cases in the clinic and completeness of documented items per form as incomplete information can bias results of the survival analysis.

Results: Based on the form analysis we discovered differences and concordances between both departments. We identified 52 attributes from which 13 were common (e.g. procedures and diagnosis dates) and were used for the generic data model. The electronic follow-up form was integrated in the clinical workflow. Survival data was also retrospectively entered in order to perform survival and quality analyses on a comprehensive data set. Physicians are now able to generate timely Kaplan-Meier plots on current data. We analysed 1029 follow-up forms of 965 patients with survival information between 1992 and 2010. Completeness of forms was 60.2%, completeness of items ranges between 94.3% and 98.5%. Median overall survival time was 16.4 years; median event-free survival time was 7.7 years.

Conclusion: It is feasible to integrate survival information into routine HIS documentation such that Kaplan-Meier plots can be generated directly and in a timely manner.";0;1;0
Analysis of the quality of hospital inform tion systems audit trails;https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6947-13-84;"Background
Audit Trails (AT) are fundamental to information security in order to guarantee access traceability but can also be used to improve Health information System�s (HIS) quality namely to assess how they are used or misused. This paper aims at analysing the existence and quality of AT, describing scenarios in hospitals and making some recommendations to improve the quality of information.

Methods
The responsibles of HIS for eight Portuguese hospitals were contacted in order to arrange an interview about the importance of AT and to collect audit trail data from their HIS. Five institutions agreed to participate in this study; four of them accepted to be interviewed, and four sent AT data. The interviews were performed in 2011 and audit trail data sent in 2011 and 2012. Each AT was evaluated and compared in relation to data quality standards, namely for completeness, comprehensibility, traceability among others. Only one of the AT had enough information for us to apply a consistency evaluation by modelling user behaviour.

Results
The interviewees in these hospitals only knew a few AT (average of 1 AT per hospital in an estimate of 21 existing HIS), although they all recognize some advantages of analysing AT. Four hospitals sent a total of 7 AT � 2 from Radiology Information System (RIS), 2 from Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS), 3 from Patient Records. Three of the AT were understandable and three of the AT were complete. The AT from the patient records are better structured and more complete than the RIS/PACS.

Conclusions
Existing AT do not have enough quality to guarantee traceability or be used in HIS improvement. Its quality reflects the importance given to them by the CIO of healthcare institutions. Existing standards (e.g. ASTM:E2147, ISO/TS 18308:2004, ISO/IEC 27001:2006) are still not broadly used in Portugal.";0;1;0
Electronic immunization data collection systems: application of an evaluation framework;https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6947-14-5;"Background
Evaluating the features and performance of health information systems can serve to strengthen the systems themselves as well as to guide other organizations in the process of designing and implementing surveillance tools. We adapted an evaluation framework in order to assess electronic immunization data collection systems, and applied it in two Ontario public health units.

Methods
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems are broad in nature and serve as an organizational tool to guide the development of comprehensive evaluation materials. Based on these Guidelines, and informed by other evaluation resources and input from stakeholders in the public health community, we applied an evaluation framework to two examples of immunization data collection and examined several system attributes: simplicity, flexibility, data quality, timeliness, and acceptability. Data collection approaches included key informant interviews, logic and completeness assessments, client surveys, and on-site observations.

Results
Both evaluated systems allow high-quality immunization data to be collected, analyzed, and applied in a rapid fashion. However, neither system is currently able to link to other providers� immunization data or provincial data sources, limiting the comprehensiveness of coverage assessments. We recommended that both organizations explore possibilities for external data linkage and collaborate with other jurisdictions to promote a provincial immunization repository or data sharing platform.

Conclusions
Electronic systems such as the ones described in this paper allow immunization data to be collected, analyzed, and applied in a rapid fashion, and represent the infostructure required to establish a population-based immunization registry, critical for comprehensively assessing vaccine coverage.";0;1;0
An evaluation of data quality in Canada's Continuing Care Reporting System (CCRS): secondary analyses of Ontario data submitted between 1996 and 2011;https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6947-13-27;"Background: Evidence informed decision making in health policy development and clinical practice depends on the availability of valid and reliable data. The introduction of interRAI assessment systems in many countries has provided valuable new information that can be used to support case mix based payment systems, quality monitoring, outcome measurement and care planning. The Continuing Care Reporting System (CCRS) managed by the Canadian Institute for Health Information has served as a data repository supporting national implementation of the Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI 2.0) in Canada for more than 15 years. The present paper aims to evaluate data quality for the CCRS using an approach that may be generalizable to comparable data holdings internationally.

Methods: Data from the RAI 2.0 implementation in Complex Continuing Care (CCC) hospitals/units and Long Term Care (LTC) homes in Ontario were analyzed using various statistical techniques that provide evidence for trends in validity, reliability, and population attributes. Time series comparisons included evaluations of scale reliability, patterns of associations between items and scales that provide evidence about convergent validity, and measures of changes in population characteristics over time.

Results: Data quality with respect to reliability, validity, completeness and freedom from logical coding errors was consistently high for the CCRS in both CCC and LTC settings. The addition of logic checks further improved data quality in both settings. The only notable change of concern was a substantial inflation in the percentage of long term care home residents qualifying for the Special Rehabilitation level of the Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-III) case mix system after the adoption of that system as part of the payment system for LTC.

Conclusions: The CCRS provides a robust, high quality data source that may be used to inform policy, clinical practice and service delivery in Ontario. Only one area of concern was noted, and the statistical techniques employed here may be readily used to target organizations with data quality problems in that (or any other) area. There was also evidence that data quality was good in both CCC and LTC settings from the outset of implementation, meaning data may be used from the entire time series. The methods employed here may continue to be used to monitor data quality in this province over time and they provide a benchmark for comparisons with other jurisdictions implementing the RAI 2.0 in similar populations.";0;0;1
Evaluation of data completeness in the electronic health record for the purpose of patient recruitment into clinical trials: a retrospective analysis of element presence;https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6947-13-37;"Background: Computerized clinical trial recruitment support is one promising field for the application of routine care data for clinical research. The primary task here is to compare the eligibility criteria defined in trial protocols with patient data contained in the electronic health record (EHR). To avoid the implementation of different patient definitions in multi-site trials, all participating research sites should use similar patient data from the EHR. Knowledge of the EHR data elements which are commonly available from most EHRs is required to be able to define a common set of criteria. The objective of this research is to determine for five tertiary care providers the extent of available data compared with the eligibility criteria of randomly selected clinical trials.

Methods: Each participating study site selected three clinical trials at random. All eligibility criteria sentences were broken up into independent patient characteristics, which were then assigned to one of the 27 semantic categories for eligibility criteria developed by Luo et al. We report on the fraction of patient characteristics with corresponding structured data elements in the EHR and on the fraction of patients with available data for these elements. The completeness of EHR data for the purpose of patient recruitment is calculated for each semantic group.

Results: 351 eligibility criteria from 15 clinical trials contained 706 patient characteristics. In average, 55% of these characteristics could be documented in the EHR. Clinical data was available for 64% of all patients, if corresponding data elements were available. The total completeness of EHR data for recruitment purposes is 35%. The best performing semantic groups were 'age' (89%), 'gender' (89%), 'addictive behaviour' (74%), 'disease, symptom and sign' (64%) and 'organ or tissue status' (61%). No data was available for 6 semantic groups.

Conclusions: There exists a significant gap in structure and content between data documented during patient care and data required for patient eligibility assessment. Nevertheless, EHR data on age and gender of the patient, as well as selected information on his disease can be complete enough to allow for an effective support of the manual screening process with an intelligent preselection of patients and patient data.";0;1;0
The Quebec BCG Vaccination Registry (1956-1992): assessing data quality and linkage with administrative health databases;https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6947-14-2;"Background: Vaccination registries have undoubtedly proven useful for estimating vaccination coverage as well as examining vaccine safety and effectiveness. However, their use for population health research is often limited. The Bacillus Calmette-Gu�rin (BCG) Vaccination Registry for the Canadian province of Quebec comprises some 4 million vaccination records (1926-1992). This registry represents a unique opportunity to study potential associations between BCG vaccination and various health outcomes. So far, such studies have been hampered by the absence of a computerized version of the registry. We determined the completeness and accuracy of the recently computerized BCG Vaccination Registry, as well as examined its linkability with demographic and administrative medical databases.

Methods: Two systematically selected verification samples, each representing ~0.1% of the registry, were used to ascertain accuracy and completeness of the electronic BCG Vaccination Registry. Agreement between the paper [listings (n = 4,987 records) and vaccination certificates (n = 4,709 records)] and electronic formats was determined along several nominal and BCG-related variables. Linkage feasibility with the Birth Registry (probabilistic approach) and provincial Healthcare Registration File (deterministic approach) was examined using nominal identifiers for a random sample of 3,500 individuals born from 1961 to 1974 and BCG vaccinated between 1970 and 1974.

Results: Exact agreement was observed for 99.6% and 81.5% of records upon comparing, respectively, the paper listings and vaccination certificates to their corresponding computerized records. The proportion of successful linkage was 77% with the Birth Registry, 70% with the Healthcare Registration File, 57% with both, and varied by birth year.

Conclusions: Computerization of this Registry yielded excellent results. The registry was complete and accurate, and linkage with administrative databases was highly feasible. This study represents the first step towards assembling large scale population-based epidemiological studies which will enable filling important knowledge gaps on the potential health effects of early life non-specific stimulation of the immune function, as resulting from BCG vaccination.";0;1;0
Are family physicians comprehensively using electronic medical records such that the data can be used for secondary purposes? A Canadian perspective;https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-015-0195-x;"Background: With the introduction and implementation of a variety of government programs and policies to encourage adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs), EMRs are being increasingly adopted in North America. We sought to evaluate the completeness of a variety of EMR fields to determine if family physicians were comprehensively using their EMRs and the suitability of use of the data for secondary purposes in Ontario, Canada.

Methods: We examined EMR data from a convenience sample of family physicians distributed throughout Ontario within the Electronic Medical Record Administrative data Linked Database (EMRALD) as extracted in the summer of 2012. We identified all physicians with at least one year of EMR use. Measures were developed and rates of physician documentation of clinical encounters, electronic prescriptions, laboratory tests, blood pressure and weight, referrals, consultation letters, and all fields in the cumulative patient profile were calculated as a function of physician and patient time since starting on the EMR.

Results: Of the 167 physicians with at least one year of EMR use, we identified 186,237 patients. Overall, the fields with the highest level of completeness were for visit documentations and prescriptions (>70%). Improvements were observed with increasing trends of completeness overtime for almost all EMR fields according to increasing physician time on EMR. Assessment of the influence of patient time on EMR demonstrated an increasing likelihood of the population of EMR fields overtime, with the largest improvements occurring between the first and second years.

Conclusions: All of the data fields examined appear to be reasonably complete within the first year of adoption with the biggest increase occurring the first to second year. Using all of the basic functions of the EMR appears to be occurring in the current environment of EMR adoption in Ontario. Thus the data appears to be suitable for secondary use.";0;1;0
Construction of quality-assured infant feeding process of care data repositories: definition and design (Part 1);https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2015.09.024;This is the first paper of a series of two regarding the construction of data quality (DQ) assured repositories for the reuse of information on infant feeding from birth until two years old. This first paper justifies the need for such repositories and describes the design of a process to construct them from Electronic Health Records (EHR). As a result, Part 1 proposes a computational process to obtain quality-assured datasets represented by a canonical structure extracted from raw data from multiple EHR. For this, 13 steps were defined to ensure the harmonization, standardization, completion, de-duplication, and consistency of the dataset content. Moreover, the quality of the input and output data for each of these steps is controlled according to eight DQ dimensions: predictive value, correctness, duplication, consistency, completeness, contextualization, temporal-stability and spatial-stability. The second paper of the series will describe the application of this computational process to construct the first quality-assured repository for the reuse of information on infant feeding in the perinatal period aimed at the monitoring of clinical activities and research.;1;0;0
Data quality assessment in healthcare: a 365-day chart review of inpatients' health records at a Nigerian tertiary hospital;https://doi.org/10.1136%2Famiajnl-2012-000823;"Background
Health records are essential for good health care. Their quality depends on accurate and prompt documentation of the care provided and regular analysis of content. This study assessed the quantitative properties of inpatient health records at the Federal Medical Centre, Bida, Nigeria.

Method
A retrospective study was carried out to assess the documentation of 780 paper-based health records of inpatients discharged in 2009.

Results
732 patient records were reviewed from the departments of obstetrics (45.90%), pediatrics (24.32%), and other specialties (29.78%). Documentation performance was very good (98.49%) for promptness recording care within the first 24?h of admission, fair (58.80%) for proper entry of patient unit number (unique identifier), and very poor (12.84%) for utilization of discharge summary forms. Overall, surgery records were nearly always (100%) prompt regarding care documentation, obstetrics records were consistent (80.65%) in entering patients' names in notes, and the principal diagnosis was properly documented in all (100%) completed discharge summary forms in medicine. 454 (62.02%) folders were chronologically arranged, 456 (62.29%) were properly held together with file tags, and most (80.60%) discharged folders reviewed, analyzed and appropriate code numbers were assigned.

Conclusions
Inadequacies were found in clinical documentation, especially gross underutilization of discharge summary forms. However, some forms were properly documented, suggesting that hospital healthcare providers possess the necessary skills for quality clinical documentation but lack the will. There is a need to institute a clinical documentation improvement program and promote quality clinical documentation among staff.

A framework for performance and data quality assessment of Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) systems in health care settings;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2010.12.004;"Objective: RFID offers great opportunities to health care. Nevertheless, prior experiences also show that RFID systems have not been designed and tested in response to the particular needs of health care settings and might introduce new risks. The aim of this study is to present a framework that can be used to assess the performance of RFID systems particularly in health care settings.

Methods: We developed a framework describing a systematic approach that can be used for assessing the feasibility of using an RFID technology in a particular healthcare setting; more specific for testing the impact of environmental factors on the quality of RFID generated data and vice versa. This framework is based on our own experiences with an RFID pilot implementation in an academic hospital in The Netherlands and a literature review concerning RFID test methods and current insights of RFID implementations in healthcare. The implementation of an RFID system within the blood transfusion chain inside a hospital setting was used as a show case to explain the different phases of the framework.

Results: The framework consists of nine phases, including an implementation development plan, RFID and medical equipment interference tests, data accuracy- and data completeness tests to be run in laboratory, simulated field and real field settings.

Conclusions: The potential risks that RFID technologies may bring to the healthcare setting should be thoroughly evaluated before they are introduced into a vital environment. The RFID performance assessment framework that we present can act as a reference model to start an RFID development, engineering, implementation and testing plan and more specific, to assess the potential risks of interference and to test the quality of the RFID generated data potentially influenced by physical objects in specific health care environments.";0;1;1
Defining and measuring completeness of electronic health records for secondary use;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2013.06.010;We demonstrate the importance of explicit definitions of electronic health record (EHR) data completeness and how different conceptualizations of completeness may impact findings from EHR-derived datasets. This study has important repercussions for researchers and clinicians engaged in the secondary use of EHR data. We describe four prototypical definitions of EHR completeness: documentation, breadth, density, and predictive completeness. Each definition dictates a different approach to the measurement of completeness. These measures were applied to representative data from NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital's clinical data warehouse. We found that according to any definition, the number of complete records in our clinical database is far lower than the nominal total. The proportion that meets criteria for completeness is heavily dependent on the definition of completeness used, and the different definitions generate different subsets of records. We conclude that the concept of completeness in EHR is contextual. We urge data consumers to be explicit in how they define a complete record and transparent about the limitations of their data.;0;1;0
