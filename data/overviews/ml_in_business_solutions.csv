Quality evaluation of product reviews using an information quality framework;The ubiquity of Web2.0 makes the Web an invaluable source of business information. For instance, product reviews composed collaboratively by many independent Internet reviewers can help consumers make purchase decisions and enable enterprises to improve their business strategies. As the number of reviews is increasing exponentially, opinion mining and retrieval techniques are needed to identify important reviews and opinions to answer users' queries. Most opinion mining and retrieval approaches try to extract sentimental or bipolar expressions from a large volume of reviews. However, the process often ignores the quality of each review and may retrieve useless or even noisy documents. In this paper, we propose a method for evaluating the quality of information in product reviews. We treat the evaluation of review quality as a classification problem and employ an effective information quality framework to extract representative review features. Experiments based on an expert-composed data corpus demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches significantly.;review or feedback
A data mining based system for credit-card fraud detection in e-tail;Credit-card fraud leads to billions of dollars in losses for online merchants. With the development of machine learning algorithms, researchers have been finding increasingly sophisticated ways to detect fraud, but practical implementations are rarely reported. We describe the development and deployment of a fraud detection system in a large e-tail merchant. The paper explores the combination of manual and automatic classification, gives insights into the complete development process and compares different machine learning methods. The paper can thus help researchers and practitioners to design and implement data mining based systems for fraud detection or similar problems. This project has contributed not only with an automatic system, but also with insights to the fraud analysts for improving their manual revision process, which resulted in an overall superior performance.;fraud detection
Optimal pricing in e-commerce based on sparse and noisy data;In today's transparent markets, e-commerce providers often have to adjust their prices within short time intervals, e.g., to take frequently changing prices of competitors into account. Automating this task of determining an “optimal” price (e.g., in terms of profit or revenue) with a learning-based approach can however be challenging. Often, only few data points are available, making it difficult to reliably detect the relationships between a given price and the resulting revenue or profit. In this paper, we propose a novel machine-learning based framework for estimating optimal prices under such constraints. The framework is generic in terms of the optimality criterion and can be customized in different ways. At its core, it implements a novel algorithm based on Bayesian inference combined with bootstrap-based confidence estimation and kernel regression. Simulation experiments show that our method is favorable over existing dynamic pricing strategies. Furthermore, the method led to a significant increase in profit and revenue in a real-world evaluation.;pricing decisions
Ranking online consumer reviews;Product reviews are posted online by the hundreds and thousands for popular products. Handling such a large volume of continuously generated online content is a challenging task for buyers, sellers and researchers. The purpose of this study is to rank the overwhelming number of reviews using their predicted helpfulness scores. The helpfulness score is predicted using features extracted from review text, product description, and customer question-answer data of a product using the random-forest classifier and gradient boosting regressor. The system classifies reviews into low or high quality with the random-forest classifier. The helpfulness scores of the high-quality reviews are only predicted using the gradient boosting regressor. The helpfulness scores of the low-quality reviews are not calculated because they are never going to be in the top k reviews. They are just added at the end of the review list to the review-listing website. The proposed system provides fair review placement on review listing pages and makes all high-quality reviews visible to customers on the top. The experimental results on data from two popular Indian e-commerce websites validate our claim, as 3–4 newer high-quality reviews are placed in the top ten reviews along with 5–6 older reviews based on review helpfulness. Our findings indicate that inclusion of features from product description data and customer question-answer data improves the prediction accuracy of the helpfulness score.;review or feedback
BEHAVIOR-BASED CUSTOMER DEMOGRAPHY PREDICTION IN E-COMMERCE.;The popularity of e-commerce is increasing day-by-day. In order to provide a seamless experience and tailored offer for the customers, the knowledge of their preferences and behavior is required. The demography of customers is one of the important information used for, e.g., segmentation. To provide optimal service, machine learning is often used for various tasks. However, the amount of data generated by customers and also large and changing product catalogs result in poorly performing models. In this paper we aim at introducing behavior-based abstraction, which includes item and event abstractions also. Our method reduces the number of unique items in the e-commerce catalog and in the next step encodes the user behavior. We performed extensive evaluation over the real-world dataset. The results suggest the usefulness of proposed abstraction and also resulted in the improvement of the demography prediction performance both from model complexity and performance point of view.

Modelling near-real-time order arrival demand in e-commerce context: a machine learning predictive methodology;Purpose Accurate prediction of order demand across omni-channel supply chains improves the management's decision-making ability at strategic, tactical and operational levels. The paper aims to develop a predictive methodology for forecasting near-real-time e-commerce order arrivals in distribution centres, allowing third-party logistics service providers to manage the hour-to-hour fast-changing arrival rates of e-commerce orders better.Design/methodology/approach The paper proposes a novel machine learning predictive methodology through the integration of the time series data characteristics into the development of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system. A four-stage implementation framework is developed for enabling practitioners to apply the proposed model.Findings A structured model evaluation framework is constructed for cross-validation of model performance. With the aid of an illustrative case study, forecasting evaluation reveals a high level of accuracy of the proposed machine learning approach in forecasting the arrivals of real e-commerce orders in three different retailers at three-hour intervals.Research limitations/implications Results from the case study suggest that real-time prediction of individual retailer's e-order arrival is crucial in order to maximize the value of e-order arrival prediction for daily operational decision-making.Originality/value Earlier researchers examined supply chain demand, forecasting problem in a broader scope, particularly in dealing with the bullwhip effect. Prediction of real-time, hourly based order arrivals has been lacking. The paper fills this research gap by presenting a novel data-driven predictive methodology.;order prediction
Machine learning and operation research based method for promotion optimization of products with no price elasticity history;Many leading e-commerce retailers adopt a consistent pricing strategy to build customer trust and promote just a small portion of their catalog each week. Promotion optimization for consistent pricing retailers is a challenging problem, as they need to decide which products to promote, with no historical price elasticity information for the candidate products. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for predicting product price elasticity impact for e-commerce retailers who use a consistent pricing strategy. We combine the commonly used operation research-based log–log demand model with the nonlinear gradient boosting machines algorithm to predict the price elasticity impact of products with no historical price elasticity information. A pessimistic prediction interval measure is used to accelerate the learning period and reduce the probability of selecting low impact promotions due to high model prediction uncertainty. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real-world dataset collected from an online European department store.;pricing decisions
Predictive analytics of E-commerce search behavior for conversion;This study explores online customer search behavior on a large e-commerce website—Walmart.com. In order to more accurately predict customer purchase conversion based on their search behavior, we adopt a modern machine-learning technique, random forest, as well as logistic regression to develop two computational models. We also integrate information retrieval literature to propose metrics to quantify online consumers’ search behavior. Results show that the random forest model performs better with a very high accuracy rate (76%) in predicting customers who will purchase the item they browsed. Among all the predictors, page and session dwell time, user type, click entropy, and click position are the strongest influential factors for the conversion behavior. The findings suggest that, with the enhanced metrics and modeling approaches, search behavior could offer strong cues about customers’ purchasing decision. Additionally, the findings also suggest operational implications about how to accommodate and induce the desired search behavior with the e-commerce website.;conversion prediction
Understanding Consumer Behavior in Electronic Commerce with Image Sentiment;Customers in electronic commerce translate available information into buying decisions based on needs and behavioural tendencies. For this purpose, shopping sites provide detailed information on products and services ranging from simple figures (e.g., dimensions) to textual descriptions, user-generated reviews and visual images. All of the aforementioned sources of information may have a substantial impact on the decision-making of customers.However, little is known about the ways in which visual information is processed and used in decision-making. As a remedy, this research seeks to shed light on the informativeness of visual content in electronic commerce. This objective represents a highly relevant area of research, since visual information plays a major role in determining price, choice and thus willingness to buy (see [1], [2]). Unfortunately, such an undertaking is challenging as we are not aware of any existing methods for measuring the degree of informativeness of images. The main focus of visual sentiment analysis has been on the classification of the sentiment of images stemming from a fairly heterogeneous set. In contrast, we aim to build a model addressing a somewhat homogeneous set of images. In our case, we use photographs from real estate listings in order to predict the rent price. As an immediate implication, our findings show operators of e-commerce or recommender systems how to optimize the presentation of their products and services. 2 Dataset In our paper, we demonstrate the added value of visual cues in electronic commerce. More precisely, we investigate how images in apartment listings can work as a predictor of the corresponding rent price. For that purpose, we utilize the data as follows: our dataset consists of 2,500 apartment listings for the Boston area, which we collected from Craigslist1 in June 2016. For each listing, we retrieved both the monthly rent and the size of the apartment, as well as the first picture shown on the webpage.;image sentiment
An e-commerce customer service robot based on intention recognition model;There are three defects for providing human-labor customer services in e-commerce operations: high costs of human labors, staff turnover, and lack of service quality assurance. Breakthroughs made in artificial intelligence, natural language processing and related fields make it possible to replace human labors with online artificial intelligent robots to provide the e-commerce customer service, which indicates the online robots are the future of e-commerce customer services. However, most of the current robots are designed to reply with knowledge matching the key words in question sentences from the database, rarely involving in research on customer intentions that are key factors influencing user experience and online sales. In this research, an intention recognizing model was proposed to obtain intentions of e-commerce consumers by computing the strengths of candidate intention nodes in the intention graph, which was used to describe relations between different goods that could be the intentional targets of e-commerce consumers. The proposed robot was constructed based on the intention recognizing model to identify intentions of consumers and use the located knowledge combined with the AIML based sentence composition template to produce the response sentences for consumers. At last, the proposed robot was evaluated using F3 and ROUGE metrics by comparing with a keyword matching robot. And the evaluation results proved the validity of the proposed robot.;customer service
Unsupervised tip-mining from customer reviews;In recent years, large review-hosting platforms have extended their functionality to allow their users to submit tips: short pieces of text that deliver valuable insight on a specific aspect of the reviewed business. These tips are meant to serve as a concise source of information that complements the often overwhelming number of customer reviews. Recent work has tackled the problem of automatically generating tips by mining review text. The motivation for this effort is to obtain tips for businesses or business aspects that have been overlooked by users. Another motivating factor is the quality of the user-submitted tips, which often provide trivial or redundant information. Existing tip-mining methods are limited by a reliance on training data, which is unlikely to be available and is also very costly to create for different domains. In this work, we present TipSelector, a completely unsupervised algorithm that delivers high quality-tips without the need for annotated training data. We verify the efficacy of TipSelector via an evaluation that includes real data from the hospitality industry and comparisons with the state-of-the-art. A secondary contribution of our work is a method for automatically evaluating tip-mining algorithms without humans in the loop. As we demonstrate in our experiments, this method can be used to enable large-scale evaluations and complement the user studies that are typically used for this purpose.;review or feedback
Capturing the essence of word-of-mouth for social commerce: Assessing the quality of online e-commerce reviews by a semi-supervised approach;In e-commerce, online product reviews significantly influence the purchase decisions of buyers and the marketing strategies employed by vendors. However, the abundance of reviews and their uneven quality make distinguishing between useful and useless reviews difficult for potential customers, thereby diminishing the benefits of online review systems. To address this problem, we develop a semi-supervised system called Online Review Quality Mining (ORQM). Embedded with independent component analysis and semi-supervised ensemble learning, ORQM exploits two opportunities: the improvement of classification performance through the use of a few labeled instances and numerous unlabeled instances, and the effectiveness of the social characteristics of e-commerce communities as identifiers of influential reviewers who write high-quality reviews. Three complementary experiments on datasets from Amazon.com show that ORQM exhibits remarkably higher performance in classifying reviews of different quality levels than do other well-accepted state-of-the-art text mining methods. The high performance of ORQM is also consistent and stable even under limited availability of labeled instances, thereby outperforming other baseline methods. The experiments also reveal that (1) the social features of reviewers are important in deriving better classification results. (2) classification results are affected by product type given the different purchase habits of consumers. and (3) reviews are contingent on the inherent nature of products, such as whether they are search goods or experience goods, and digital products or physical products, through which purchase decisions are influenced.;review or feedback
Learning to rank products based on online product reviews using a hierarchical deep neural network;Product ranking based on online product reviews is a task of inferring relative user preferences between different products as a variant of entity-level sentiment analysis. Despite the complex relationship between the overall user’s preference and individual diverse opinions, existing approaches generally employ empirical assumptions about sentiment features of the products of interest. In this paper, we propose a novel unified approach for learning to rank products based on online product reviews. Unlike existing approaches, it uses deep-learning techniques to extract the high-level latent review representation that contains the most semantic information in the learning process. For this approach, we extend the recently proposed hierarchical attention network to operate in the ranking domain. This network hierarchically learns optimal feature representations of the products and their reviews through the use of two-level attention-based encoders. To construct a more advanced ranking model, several features were added to give sufficient information about the relative user preferences, and two representative ranking loss functions, RankNet and ListNet, were applied. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this network outperforms the existing methods in sales rank prediction based on online product reviews.;review or feedback
Predicting long-term product ratings based on few early ratings and user base analysis;Product reviews and ratings are major quality indicators in online shopping systems. In making the decision about carrying a product as part of their inventory, an online seller often pays attention to the product’s rating. However, when the observed average is based on a small number of individual user-submitted ratings, the decision-maker may not feel as confident about the product, even when the average is high. The long-term average rating predictions can help online retailers to identify products to promote on their websites as “top picks”. The paper proposes a Bayesian Network model to predict the long-term average product ratings based on a (limited) number of early submitted ratings. Performance of the proposed model is compared with the performance of five other prediction methods/models. a Linear Regression model, two variations of a Running Average predictor, an Ordered Logistic Regression model and a Confirmatory Factor Analysis model. Each model’s performance is evaluated using the “MovieLens” dataset (GroupLensResearch, 2012). The training is done on 56,590 data points, the ratings submitted for 1155 movies, and the prediction results are reported for 495 movies. It is demonstrated that the proposed Bayesian Network and the Linear Regression models are particularly effective in making accurate predictions around the time of product introduction when the information about the prospective, future ratings is especially valuable. The Bayesian Network model performs better in the very early stage of feedback collection, and in the later stages, as more feedback is received, the Linear Regression model emerges as the best predictor. The strengths and weaknesses of all the assessed prediction methods are discussed.;review or feedback
Combining user preferences and user opinions for accurate recommendation;Recommendation systems represent a popular research area with a variety of applications. Such systems provide personalized services to the user and help address the problem of information overload. Traditional recommendation methods such as collaborative filtering suffer from low accuracy because of data sparseness though. We propose a novel recommendation algorithm based on analysis of an online review. The algorithm incorporates two new methods for opinion mining and recommendation. As opposed to traditional methods, which are usually based on the similarity of ratings to infer user preferences, the proposed recommendation method analyzes the difference between the ratings and opinions of the user to identify the user’s preferences. This method considers explicit ratings and implicit opinions, an action that can address the problem of data sparseness. We propose a new feature and opinion extraction method based on the characteristics of online reviews to extract effectively the opinion of the user from a customer review written in Chinese. Based on these methods, we also conduct an empirical study of online restaurant customer reviews to create a restaurant recommendation system and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.;recommendation
Recommender systems based on quantitative implicit customer feedback;Due to the abundant variety of products offered by e-commerce companies and online service providers, recommender systems become an increasingly important decision aid for customers. In this paper we focus on quantitative implicit customer feedback like sales and play records data. We extend the current state-of-the-art method for recommendations based on matrix factorization under a normal distribution assumption by allowing for different distributions which are more suitable to model this kind of data. In particular, we use the Poisson, the inverse Gaussian and the gamma distribution as extensions. The experimental evaluation with three real-world data sets shows the improved performance of our approach and we demonstrate the merit of using various distributions depending on the respective data set.;recommendation
Integrating a semantic-based retrieval agent into case-based reasoning systems: A case study of an online bookstore;Natural language search engines should be developed to provide a friendly environment for business-to-consumer e-commerce that reduce the fatigue customers experience and help them decide what to buy. To support product information retrieval and reuse, this paper presents a novel framework for a case-based reasoning system that includes a collaborative filtering mechanism and a semantic-based case retrieval agent. Furthermore, the case retrieval agent integrates short-text semantic similarity (STSS) and recognizing textual entailment (RTE). The proposed approach was evaluated using competitive methods in the performance of STSS and RTE, and according to the results, the proposed approach outperforms most previously described approaches. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach was investigated using a case study of an online bookstore, and according to the results of case study, the proposed approach outperforms a compared system using string similarity and an existing e-commerce system, Amazon.;recommendation
Deep learning based personalized recommendation with multi-view information integration;With the rapid proliferation of images on e-commerce platforms today, embracing and integrating versatile information sources have become increasingly important in recommender systems. Owing to the heterogeneity in information sources and consumers, it is necessary and meaningful to consider the potential synergy between visual and textual content as well as consumers' different cognitive styles. This paper proposes a multi-view model, namely, Deep Multi-view Information iNtEgration (Deep-MINE), to take multiple sources of content (i.e., product images, descriptions and review texts) into account and design an end-to-end recommendation model. In doing so, stacked auto-encoder networks are deployed to map multi-view information into a unified latent space, a cognition layer is added to depict consumers' heterogeneous cognition styles and an integration module is introduced to reflect the interaction of multi-view latent representations. Extensive experiments on real world data demonstrate that Deep-MINE achieves high accuracy in product ranking, especially in the cold-start case. In addition, Deep-MINE is able to boost overall model performance compared with models taking a single view, further verifying the proposed model's effectiveness on information integration.;recommendation
A multi-theoretical kernel-based approach to social network-based recommendation;Recommender systems are a critical component of e-commerce websites. The rapid development of online social networking services provides an opportunity to explore social networks together with information used in traditional recommender systems, such as customer demographics, product characteristics, and transactions. It also provides more applications for recommender systems. To tackle this social network-based recommendation problem, previous studies generally built trust models in light of the social influence theory. This study inspects a spectrum of social network theories to systematically model the multiple facets of a social network and infer user preferences. In order to effectively make use of these heterogonous theories, we take a kernel-based machine learning paradigm, design and select kernels describing individual similarities according to social network theories, and employ a non-linear multiple kernel learning algorithm to combine the kernels into a unified model. This design also enables us to consider multiple theories' interactions in assessing individual behaviors. We evaluate our proposed approach on a real-world movie review data set. The experiments show that our approach provides more accurate recommendations than trust-based methods and the collaborative filtering approach. Further analysis shows that kernels derived from contagion theory and homophily theory contribute a larger portion of the model.;recommendation
A cross-domain recommender system with consistent information transfer;Recommender systems provide users with personalized online product and service recommendations and are a ubiquitous part of today's online entertainment smorgasbord. However, many suffer from cold-start problems due to a lack of sufficient preference data, and this is hindering their development. Cross-domain recommender systems have been proposed as one possible solution. These systems transfer knowledge from one domain that has adequate preference information to another domain that does not. The outlook for cross-domain recommendation is promising, but existing methods cannot ensure the knowledge extracted from the source domain is consistent with the target domain, which may impact the accuracy of the recommendations. To address this challenging issue, we propose a cross-domain recommender system with consistent information transfer (CIT). Knowledge consistency is based on user and item latent groups, and domain adaptation techniques are used to map and adjust these groups in both domains to maintain consistency during the transfer learning process. Experiments were conducted on five real-world datasets in three categories: movies, books, and music. The results for nine cross-domain recommendation tasks show that CIT outperforms five benchmarks and increases the accuracy of recommendations in the target domain, especially with sparse data. Practically, our proposed method is applied into a telecom product recommender system and a business partner recommender system (Smart BizSeeker) to enhance personalized decision making for both businesses and individual customers.;recommendation
A Novel Recommendation Model for Online-to-Offline Service Based on the Customer Network and Service Location;We propose a new online-to-offline (O2O) service recommendation method based on a novel customer network and service location (CNLRec) in order to help customer to choose the “ideal” O2O services from a large set of alternatives. Our customer network, based on the “co-used” behaviors obtained from the online rating matrix, captures customers’ online behaviors while service location reflects offline behavior characteristic of the customer. For a target customer, a ranking of candidate services based on their locations and this network is generated, in which customer scale usage bias is eliminated. Our experimental results show that: First, even though the rating matrix is sparse, most customers are connected to our proposed customer network, which largely addresses the problem of sparse data. Second, CNLRec outperforms widely-used and state-of-the-art recommendation methods. In addition, e-commerce recommendations that use CNLRec without including item location information (CNRec) has better performance than existing methods. Third, all attributes in CNLRec, including network attributes (relationship degree and customer attribute) and location attributes, play a significant role in recommendations. Specially, O2O service location plays an important role in O2O service selection. In our research, we find the optimal combinations of these attributes.;recommendation
A Picture Is Worth More Than a Thousand Purchases: Designing an Image-Based Fashion Curation System;Online retailing has been experiencing explosive growth for years and is dramatically reshaping the way people shop. Given the lack of personal interactions fashion retailers have to establish compelling service and information offerings to sustain this growth trajectory. A recent manifestation of this is the emergence of shopping curation as a service. For this purpose, experts manually craft individual outfits based on customer information from questionnaires. For the retailers as well as for the customers, this process entails severe weaknesses, particularly with regard to immediateness, scalability, and perceived financial risks. To overcome these limitations, we present an artificial fashion curation system for individual outfit recommendations that leverages deep learning techniques and unstructured data from social media and fashion blogs. Here, we lay out the artifact design and provide a comprehensive evaluation strategy to assess the system's utility.;recommendation
A semantic enhanced hybrid recommendation approach: A case study of e-Government tourism service recommendation system;Recommender systems are effectively used as a personalized information filtering technology to automatically predict and identify a set of interesting items on behalf of users according to their personal needs and preferences. Collaborative Filtering (CF) approach is commonly used in the context of recommender systems. however, obtaining better prediction accuracy and overcoming the main limitations of the standard CF recommendation algorithms, such as sparsity and cold-start item problems, remain a significant challenge. Recent developments in personalization and recommendation techniques support the use of semantic enhanced hybrid recommender systems, which incorporate ontology-based semantic similarity measure with other recommendation approaches to improve the quality of recommendations. Consequently, this paper presents the effectiveness of utilizing semantic knowledge of items to enhance the recommendation quality. It proposes a new Inferential Ontology-based Semantic Similarity (IOBSS) measure to evaluate semantic similarity between items in a specific domain of interest by taking into account their explicit hierarchical relationships, shared attributes and implicit relationships. The paper further proposes a hybrid semantic enhanced recommendation approach by combining the new IOBSS measure and the standard item-based CF approach. A set of experiments with promising results validates the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid approach, using a case study of the Australian e-Government tourism services.;recommendation
Embedding unstructured side information in product recommendation;Various researchers have already engaged in using auxiliary side information within recommender applications to improve the quality and accuracy of recommendations. This side information has either been in the form of structured information such as product specifications and user demographic information or unstructured information such as product reviews. The abundance of unstructured information compared to structured information entices the use of such unstructured information in the recommendation process. Existing works that employ unstructured content have been confined to standard text modeling technique such as the use of frequency measures or topic modeling techniques. In this paper, we propose to model unstructured content about both products and users through the exploitation of word embedding techniques. More specifically, we propose to learn both user and product representations from any type of unstructured textual contents available in different external information sources using recurrent neural networks. We then apply our learnt product and user representations on two recommendation frameworks based on matrix factorization and link prediction to enhance the recommendation task. Experimental results on four datasets constructed from the Rotten Tomatoes website (movie review aggregator database) have shown the effectiveness of our proposed approach in different real-world situations compared to the state of the art.;recommendation
A unified framework of active transfer learning for cross-system recommendation;In the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been successfully applied to recommender systems employed in many e-commerce companies, such as Amazon, eBay, Netflix, etc., which aim to provide personalized recommendations on products or services. Among various AI-based recommendation techniques, collaborative filtering has proven to be one of the most promising methods. However, most collaborative-filtering-based recommender systems, especially the newly launched ones, have trouble making accurate recommendations for users. This is caused by the data sparsity issue in recommender systems, where little existing rating information is available. To address this issue, one of the most effective practices is applying transfer learning techniques by leveraging relatively rich collaborative data knowledge from related systems, which have been well running. Previous transfer learning models for recommender systems often assume that a sufficient set of entity correspondences (either user or item) across the target and auxiliary systems (a.k.a. source systems) is given in advance. This assumption does not hold in many real-world scenarios where entity correspondences across systems are usually unknown, and the cost of identifying them can be expensive. In this paper, we propose a new transfer learning framework for recommender systems, which relaxes the above assumption to facilitate flexible knowledge transfer across different systems with low cost by using an active learning principle to construct entity correspondences across systems. Specifically, for the purpose of maximizing knowledge transfer, we first iteratively select entities in the target system based on some criterion to query their correspondences in the source system. We then plug the actively constructed entity correspondences into a general transferred collaborative-filtering model to improve recommendation quality. Based on the framework, we propose three solutions by specifying three state-of-the-art collaborative filtering methods, namely Maximum-Margin Matrix Factorization, Regularized Low-rank Matrix Factorization, and Probabilistic Matrix Factorization. We perform extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework and the three specified solutions for cross-system recommendation.;recommendation
