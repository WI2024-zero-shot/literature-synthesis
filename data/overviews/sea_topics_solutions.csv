An Optimal Mechanism for Sponsored Search Auctions on the Web and Comparison With Other Mechanisms;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2009.2021975;In this paper, we first describe a framework to model the sponsored search auction on the Web as a mechanism design problem. Using this framework, we describe two well-known mechanisms for sponsored search auction - generalized second price (GSP) and Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG). We then derive a new mechanism for sponsored search auction which we call optimal (OPT) mechanism. The OPT mechanism maximizes the search engine's expected revenue, while achieving Bayesian incentive compatibility and individual rationality of the advertisers. We then undertake a detailed comparative study of the mechanisms GSP, VCG, and OPT. We compute and compare the expected revenue earned by the search engine under the three mechanisms when the advertisers are symmetric and some special conditions are satisfied. We also compare the three mechanisms in terms of incentive compatibility, individual rationality, and computational complexity.;auction mechanism design
Optimal Quality Scores in Sponsored Search Auctions: Full Extraction of Advertisers' Surplus;https://doi.org/10.2202/1935-1704.1649;This paper shows that the quality scores in sponsored search auctions can be optimally chosen to extract all the advertisers' surplus. The reason for the full extraction result is that the quality scores may effectively set all the bidders' valuations equal to the highest valuation, which induces intense bidding competition.;auction mechanism design
Optimal equilibrium bidding strategies for budget constrained bidders in sponsored search auctions;https://doi.org/10.1007/s12351-010-0097-8;"Budget optimization (selecting an optimal set of keywords to bid for, given a limited amount of budget) and bid optimization (determining optimal bids for the selected keywords) in the face of an unpredictable keyword traffic is a challenging problem facing advertisers in sponsored search auctions. Another key requirement in sponsored search auctions is stability of the bid profile, which is usually characterized through the notion of locally envy-free equilibrium. A variety of budget optimization and bid optimization ideas have been proposed in the literature; the bid profiles suggested by them have varying stability properties. In this paper, our objective is to come up with a bidding strategy for advertisers that is optimal for the budget optimization as well as the bid optimization problems and also guarantees convergence to a locally envy-free equilibrium. Our approach works with a linear program for the budget optimization problem whose optimal solution is a greedy strategy, which we call the OPT strategy. The OPT strategy yields a bid profile that maximizes the return on investment for the advertisers and ensures convergence of the bid profiles to a locally envy-free equilibrium in the asynchronous case as well as in a restricted synchronous case. We also suggest an improved strategy called the MAX strategy which produces equal or higher advertiser utilities compared to the OPT strategy while enjoying identical equilibrium convergence properties as OPT.";keyword selection
From Generic to Branded: A Model of Spillover in Paid Search Advertising;https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.1.8;In Internet paid search advertising, marketers pay for search engines to serve text advertisements in response to keyword searches that are generic (e.g., �hotels�) or branded (e.g., �Hilton Hotels�). Although standalone metrics usually show that generic keywords have higher apparent costs to the advertiser than branded keywords, generic search may create a spillover effect on subsequent branded search. Building on the Nerlove�Arrow advertising framework, the authors propose a dynamic linear model to capture the potential spillover from generic to branded paid search. In the model, generic search advertisements serve to expose users to information about the brand's ability to meet their needs, raising awareness that the brand is relevant to the search. In turn, this can induce additional future search activity for keywords that include the brand name. Using a Bayesian estimation approach, the authors apply the model to data from a paid search campaign for a major lodging chain. The results show that generic search activity positively affects future branded search activity through awareness of relevance. However, branded search does not affect generic search, demonstrating that the spillover is asymmetric. The findings have implications for understanding search behavior on the Internet and the management of paid search advertising.;bidding strategy optimization
Sponsored Search and Market Efficiency;http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1660646;Sponsored search is the mechanism whereby where advertisers pay a fee to Internet search engines to be displayed alongside organic (non-sponsored) web search results. Based on prior literature, we draw an analogy between these markets and financial markets. We use the analogy as well as the key differences to present a theoretical framework consisting of a set of research questions about the pricing of keywords and design choices available to firms in sponsored search markets. These questions define an agenda for future research in sponsored search markets. They also have practical implications for advertisers and online marketplaces such as search engines and social media sites that support advertising.;bidding strategy optimization
Forecasting Click-Through Rates Based on Sponsored Search Advertiser Bids and Intermediate Variable Regression;https://doi.org/10.1145/1852096.1852099;"To participate in sponsored search online advertising, an advertiser bids on a set of keywords relevant to his/her product or service. When one of these keywords matches a user search string, the ad is then considered for display among sponsored search results. Advertisers compete for positions in which their ads appear, as higher slots typically result in more user clicks. All existing position allocating mechanisms charge more per click for a higher slot. Therefore, an advertiser must decide whether to bid high and receive more, but more expensive, clicks.

In this work, we propose a novel methodology for building forecasting landscapes relating an individual advertiser bid to the expected click-through rate and/or the expected daily click volume. Displaying such landscapes is currently offered as a service to advertisers by all major search engine providers. Such landscapes are expected to be instrumental in helping the advertisers devise their bidding strategies.

We propose a triply monotone regression methodology. We start by applying the current state-of-the-art monotone regression solution. We then propose to condition on the ad position and to estimate the bid-position and position-click effects separately. While the latter translates into a standard monotone regression problem, we devise a novel solution to the former based on approximate maximum likelihood. We show that our proposal significantly outperforms the standard monotone regression solution, while the latter similarly improves upon routinely used ad-hoc methods.

Last, we discuss other e-commerce applications of the proposed intermediate variable regression methodology.";bidding strategy optimization
An analysis of the importance of the long tail in search engine marketing;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.elerap.2010.05.001;Search engine marketing is currently the most popular form of online advertising. Many advertising agencies and bloggers claim that the success of search engine marketing is driven by the �long tail�, defined in this research as the many less popular keywords employed by users to search the Internet, and suggest that search engine marketing campaigns need to have hundreds or thousands of keywords to accommodate this phenomenon. We doubt this claim. Our data from three search engine marketing campaigns in two countries, which report the success of a total of 4908 keywords over 36 weeks, covering 10,104,015 searches and 492,735 clicks, show that the top 20% of all keywords attract on average 98.16% of all searches and generate 97.21% of all clicks. The use of the top 100 keywords in each campaign attracts on average 88.57% of all searches and 81.40% of all clicks. These results are fairly stable across a varying total number of keywords in use and suggest that the success of search engine marketing is driven by relatively few keywords. However, we also show that the set of the top 100 keywords changes over time. Hence, advertisers need to concentrate on finding the top 100 keywords, but they do not need to bother too much about the performance of keywords in the long tail.;keyword selection
Using a two-stage technique to design a keyword suggestion system;http://informationr.net/ir/15-1/paper425.html;"Introduction. The study of keyword suggestion in the field of search engine marketing is an important issue for paid search advertising or sponsored advertisements. The challenge of this issue is not only to suggest the relevant keywords, but also to find more such keywords.
Method. In this paper, we propose a system, the main goal of which is not only to suggest a list of relevant keywords, but also to determine the degree of similarity between the user's query and each suggested keyword.
Analysis. Three experiments were performed to illustrate the performance comparison between different systems and the relevant parameters considered in our system.
Results. According to the results of the first experiment, our system was found to be better than other online systems. According to the results of the second experiment, we concluded that the performance of the latent semantic analysis probability model is better than the random probability model. According to the results of the third experiment, we verified that the termination criteria of our system could yield a cost effective solution within a controlled period of time.
Conclusions. In this paper, we make several contributions. First, we propose an intelligent system that is based on several semantic analysis methods. Second, we define a new performance metric to compare the results of different systems. Third, we design a combined technique to find a cost effective solution within controlled period of time.";keyword selection
Analyzing the Relationship Between Organic and Sponsored Search Advertising: Positive, Negative, or Zero Interdependence?;https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.1090.0552;The phenomenon of paid search advertising has now become the most predominant form of online advertising in the marketing world. However, we have little understanding of the impact of search engine advertising on consumers' responses in the presence of organic listings of the same firms. In this paper, we model and estimate the interrelationship between organic search listings and paid search advertisements. We use a unique panel data set based on aggregate consumer response to several hundred keywords over a three-month period collected from a major nationwide retailer store chain that advertises on Google. In particular, we focus on understanding whether the presence of organic listings on a search engine is associated with a positive, a negative, or no effect on the click-through rates of paid search advertisements, and vice versa for a given firm. We first build an integrated model to estimate the relationship between different metrics such as search volume, click-through rates, conversion rates, cost per click, and keyword ranks. A hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework is used and the model is estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Our empirical findings suggest that click-throughs on organic listings have a positive interdependence with click-throughs on paid listings, and vice versa. We also find that this positive interdependence is asymmetric such that the impact of organic clicks on increases in utility from paid clicks is 3.5 times stronger than the impact of paid clicks on increases in utility from organic clicks. Using counterfactual experiments, we show that on an average this positive interdependence leads to an increase in expected profits for the firm ranging from 4.2% to 6.15% when compared to profits in the absence of this interdependence. To further validate our empirical results, we also conduct and present the results from a controlled field experiment. This experiment shows that total click-through rates, conversions rates, and revenues in the presence of both paid and organic search listings are significantly higher than those in the absence of paid search advertisements. The results predicted by the econometric model are also corroborated in this field experiment, which suggests a causal interpretation to the positive interdependence between paid and organic search listings. Given the increased spending on search engine-based advertising, our analysis provides critical insights to managers in both traditional and Internet firms.;search engine result page analysis
What Users See - Structures in Search Engine Results Pages;https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1511.05802;This paper investigates the composition of search engine results pages. We define what elements the most popular web search engines use on their results pages (e.g., organic results, advertisements, shortcuts) and to which degree they are used for popular vs. rare queries. Therefore, we send 500 queries of both types to the major search engines Google, Yahoo, this http URL and Ask. We count how often the different elements are used by the individual engines. In total, our study is based on 42,758 elements. Findings include that search engines use quite different approaches to results pages composition and therefore, the user gets to see quite different results sets depending on the search engine and search query used. Organic results still play the major role in the results pages, but different shortcuts are of some importance, too. Regarding the frequency of certain host within the results sets, we find that all search engines show Wikipedia results quite often, while other hosts shown depend on the search engine used. Both Google and Yahoo prefer results from their own offerings (such as YouTube or Yahoo Answers). Since we used the .com interfaces of the search engines, results may not be valid for other country-specific interfaces.;search engine result page analysis
Overlap among major web search engines;https://doi.org/10.1108/10662240610690034;"Purpose
This paper reports the findings of a major study examining the overlap among results retrieved by three major web search engines. The goal of the research was to: measure the overlap across three major web search engines on the first results page overlap (i.e. share the same results) and the differences across a wide range of user defined search terms; determine the differences in the first page of search results and their rankings (each web search engine's view of the most relevant content) across single?source web search engines, including both sponsored and non?sponsored results; and measure the degree to which a meta?search web engine, such as Dogpile.com, provides searchers with the most highly ranked search results from three major single source web search engines.

Design/methodology/approach
The authors collected 10,316 random Dogpile.com queries and ran an overlap algorithm using the URL for each result by query. The overlap of first result page search for each query was then summarized across all 10,316 to determine the overall overlap metrics. For a given query, the URL of each result for each engine was retrieved from the database.

Findings
The percent of total results unique retrieved by only one of the three major web search engines was 85 percent, retrieved by two web search engines was 12 percent, and retrieved by all three web search engines was 3 percent. This small level of overlap reflects major differences in web search engines retrieval and ranking results.

Research limitations/implications
This study provides an important contribution to the web research literature. The findings point to the value of meta?search engines in web retrieval to overcome the biases of single search engines.

Practical implications
The results of this research can inform people and organizations that seek to use the web as part of their information seeking efforts, and the design of web search engines.

Originality/value
This research is a large investigation into web search engine overlap using real data from a major web meta?search engine and single web search engines that sheds light on the uniqueness of top results retrieved by web search engines.";search engine result page analysis
The Economics of Click Fraud;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2010.88;Click fraud is a substantial threat in the cyberworld. Here, the author examines the contexts, mechanisms, and processes associated with the click-fraud industry from an economics viewpoint. The nature of electronic channels, characterized by asymmetric hypermediation, provides a fertile ground for such fraud. Click fraud is arguably the cyberworld's biggest scam. Illegitimate clicks on pay-per-click (PPC) advertisements have rekindled debate about online advertising's effectiveness. Cybercriminals involved in diverse activities are expanding their operations into lucrative businesses in the PPC industry. At the heart of the click-fraud problem is the fact that site owners benefit from clicks made to ads on their sites. Search engine network partners, competitors, and unhappy employees can all generate illegitimate clicks. Here, I examine the contexts, mechanisms, and processes associated with the click-fraud industry from an economics viewpoint.;click fraud issues
The Glitch in On-line Advertising: A Study of Click Fraud in Pay-Per-Click Advertising Programs;https://doi.org/10.2753/JEC1086-4415130204;Click fraud is a growing concern for pay-per-click (PPC) advertising programs. An ethical behavior model is proposed that includes evaluation, consequences for others, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. The model, which integrates elements from the theory of reasoned action, the theory of planned behavior, and deterrence theory, was tested using data collected from 155 subjects who were familiar with PPC programs. The results can be used by PPC service providers and law-makers in developing strategies to curb this problem.;click fraud issues
Is There an On-line Advertisers' Dilemma? A Study of Click Fraud in the Pay-Per-Click Model;https://www.jstor.org/stable/27751287;This study develops a theoretical model, based on the theory of reasoned action and the concept of behavioral calculus, for understanding on-line advertiser behavior. Structural equation modeling and survey data are used to test hypotheses on how beliefs about on-line pay-per-click advertising shape the attitudes and subjective norms that lead advertisers to advertise on-line. The roles of trust, third-party tools, and support from search engine providers are explored. The study confirms that attitudes and subjective norms significantly influence intention to advertise on-line using the pay-per-click model, but trust in search engine providers and third-party monitoring and filtering tools are also found to have central roles. Trust can significantly increase the perceived benefits, in addition to its direct positive impact on attitude and subjective norms. The perceived effectiveness of third-party tools has a positive impact on attitude and trust, and thus on intention to advertise on-line.;click fraud issues
Information search and paid results � proposition and test of a hierarchy-of-effect model;https://doi.org/10.1007/s12525-009-0015-1;Search engines stand as the first entry point to internet resources for 70% of users. The results page is therefore an appealing place for advertising in the form of sponsored links also called paid results. Yet little academic knowledge has been developed to understand users� perceptions and behaviors toward sponsored links. In particular it is of foremost importance to delineate factors that influence click intention and behavior. This paper proposes a hierarchy-of-effects model in order to understand surfers� click on sponsored links. An empirical study is conducted over 349 participants confronted to three different Search Engine Result Pages (SERP) representing three search situations. Results indicate a significant relationship between attitude toward sponsored links and behavioral intention. In addition, past satisfaction is found to significantly predict click behavior. The contribution of this study for both researchers and practitioners is discussed.;web searchers' behaviour and practice
Sponsored Search: Is Money a Motivator for Providing Relevant Results?;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MC.2007.290;"Analysis of data from a major metasearch engine reveals that sponsored-link click-through rates appear lower than previously reported. Combining sponsored and nonsponsored links in a single listing, while providing some benefits to users, does not appear to increase clicks on sponsored listings. In a competitive market, rivals continually strive to improve their information-retrieval capabilities and increase their financial returns. One innovation is sponsored search, an ""economics meets search"" model in which content providers pay search engines for user traffic going from the search engine to their Web sites. Sponsored search has proven to be a successful business model for Web search engines, advertisers, and online vendors, as well as an effective way to deliver content to searchers. The ""impact of sponsored search"" sidebar describes some of the model's notable benefits.";web searchers' behaviour and practice
The intention to click on sponsored ads�A study of the role of prior knowledge and of consumer profile;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jretconser.2010.06.002;The activity of e-tailers relies entirely on their ability to attract potential consumers to their websites. This research addresses online consumer reactions toward today�s major online advertising tool that is sponsored ads. It examines the moderating role of prior knowledge. An online survey is conducted on 272 actual Internet users. The results support the moderating role of prior knowledge and suggest that when Internet users are knowledgeable of sponsored links and hold a favorable attitude toward them, the positive impact on click intention is reinforced. The profile of favorable surfers is very close to the one of online shoppers.;web searchers' behaviour and practice
Advertisers' perceptions of search engine marketing;http://dx.doi.org/10.1504/IJIMA.2009.021952;The objective of this study is to examine advertisers' perceptions of search engine marketing. The theoretical part of the study investigates the two aspects of search engine marketing, namely advertising and optimisation. With the use of a qualitative case study conducted with leading search engine marketers and experts in Finland, the paper suggests that search engine marketing is still in its infancy among Finnish companies. Whereas small-sized dot-com companies operating in the Business-to-Business (B2B) sector have been most active in search engine marketing, traditional brick-and-mortars are just starting to set plans for search engine marketing. Finally, the study discusses the implications and provides future research directions.;advertisers' behaviour and practice
The use of digital channels to create customer relationships;http://dx.doi.org/10.1504/IJIMA.2010.030430;The interest in relationship marketing and especially relationship dynamics among academics and practitioners is growing. The focus is on expanding maintaining relationships to the whole relationship life cycle, including relationship initiation. However, research concerning relationships in a digital context or in a context where customer-company interactions occur through technology interfaces is scarce. To our knowledge there is no research on how the relationships begin in such a context. This paper explores the role of digital channels in the creation of customer relationships. Digital channels denote methods for customer-company interactions through technology interfaces such as e-mail, Short Message Service (SMS), and webpages. An exploratory qualitative study was conducted with business executives. The findings indicate that identifying relationship initiation is challenging and that the initiation differs between Business-to-Business (B2B) and Business-to-Customer (B2C) relationships. Digital and interpersonal contacts are frequently used simultaneously in creating customer relationships. Digital marketing activities such as search engine advertisements and direct e-mails are important. The paper integrates a digital perspective to relationship dynamics research. It contributes to e-service research by focusing on relationship dynamics. It also extends relationship marketing research by exploring relationship initiation.;advertisers' behaviour and practice

Economic and Business Dimensions Search Engine Advertising;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1400214.1400222;Search engine advertising, identifying and using customer's own search terms to match customer's interest with advertisers, have an advantage over other online advertising. An examination of match difficult affecting an advertiser decision is done by using data from a Web site portal and combining the data with information about the popularity of the search terms. A correlation in the data between a lack of searches and higher prices is found and a casual link is established by exploiting a natural experiment resulting from the user behavior. Search engine advertising is most valuable when firms have a few hard-to-reach customers, such that match difficulty between ad prices and regulations needs to be addressed. The profitability of search markets for search engines is highly dependent on the availability of alternative marketing communications channels that are online and offline.;real outcomes of search engine advertising

Sponsored search: an overview of the concept, history, and technology;https://doi.org/10.1504/IJEB.2008.018068;The success of sponsored search has radically affected how people interact with the information, websites, and services on the web. Sponsored search provides the necessary revenue streams to web search engines and is critical to the success of many online businesses. However, there has been limited academic examination of sponsored search, with the exception of online auctions. In this paper, we conceptualise the sponsored search process as an aspect of information searching. We provide a brief history of sponsored search and an extensive examination of the technology making sponsored search possible. We critique this technology, highlighting possible implications for the future of the sponsored search process.;reviews on search engine advertising
And Then There Were Three;https://doi.org/10.1109/MC.2009.36;"Consolidation in the search engine industry poses a serious threat to the quality of information available to citizens and scientists and to the ability of individuals and organizations to exercise the right of free speech. It makes little difference whether there is a monopoly of one or an oligopoly of three search engine companies. In either case, there is a need for oversight or regulation, or for increased search engine competition. If a ""natural monopoly"" on searches exists, the public interest would best be served by government oversight; if a monopoly or oligopoly is not natural to the provisioning of search technology, competition should be stimulated and nurtured. However, if market forces do not work to inhibit monopoly or oligopoly, controls should be imposed on the dominant firms. Such control could take the form of regular performance testing to ensure unbiased search results and the absence of impediments to the exercise of free speech.";reviews on search engine advertising
Technical, Automatic and Passive: Liability of Search Engines for Hosting Infringing Content in the Light of the Google Ruling;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49596641_Technical_Automatic_and_Passive_Liability_of_Search_Engines_for_Hosting_Infringing_Content_in_the_Light_of_the_Google_ruling;The present contribution discusses the latest ruling of the European Court of Justice in the case of Google, which may have deeper consequences for advertisers relying on AdWords service, as well as for providers of similar services around the globe. The Court ruling may turn out to be even more important for Web 2.0 service providers as it seems to have opened the possibility of applying for a legal protection under Article 14 of the Ecommerce Directive. European judges made it clear that sponsored links services are information society services and that they may fall under the sphere of application of hosting safe haven provided that their activities are of technical, automatic and passive nature understood as a lack of knowledge or control over the data stored. This statement is yet to be applied by French courts that will have to establish whether Google AdWords service is really neutral and hence deserves a special legal treatment.;legal aspects of engine advertising
