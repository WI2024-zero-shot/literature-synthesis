In this paper, we describe a new ranking algorithm that directly maximizes the number of relevant objects retrieved at the absolute top of the list. The algorithm is a support vector style algorithm, but due to the different objective, it no longer leads to a quadratic programming problem. Instead, the dual optimization problem involves l1, ∞ constraints; we solve this dual problem using the recent l1, ∞ projection method of Quattoni et al (2009). Our algorithm can be viewed as an l∞-norm extreme of the lp-norm based algorithm of Rudin (2009) (albeit in a support vector setting rather than a boosting setting); thus we refer to the algorithm as the ‘Infinite Push’. Experiments on real-world data sets confirm the algorithm’s focus on accuracy at the absolute top of the list.

For developing countries like Ethiopia which has a growing ICT, cloud computing is an attractive choice to adopt. However, the adoption of such a technology should be planned ahead of time taking into consideration the various factors that make adoption successful. The main objective of this research is to propose a cloud readiness assessment framework and an expert system that assesses cloud readiness and recommend which cloud deployment and service model to adopt. The research is grounded by well-studied technological innovation adoption theories: Technology Organization Environment framework (TOE), Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Based on these theoretical foundations, a new cloud readiness framework is proposed. A survey is designed based on the framework; using this survey an initial dataset is generated and expanded using synthetic data generator. The expert system relies on predictive modeling for assessing cloud readiness. So, using Weka machine learning platform, J48 decision tree algorithm is experimented using various settings, to train and obtain acceptable model accuracy. Training is performed on the original dataset and synthetically generated dataset. The best obtained model accuracy is 75% with the original dataset.";supervised learningSVM-based association rules for knowledge discovery and classification;Anaissi & Goyal;2015;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/APWCCSE.2015.7476236;Improving analysis of market basket data requires the development of approaches that lead to recommendation systems that are tailored to specifically benefit grocery chain. The main purpose of that is to find relationships existing among the sales of the products that can help retailer identify new opportunities for cross-selling their products to customers. This paper aims to discover knowledge patterns hidden in large data set that can yield more understanding to the data holders and identify new opportunities for imperative tasks including strategic planning and decision making. This paper delivers a strategy for the implementation of a systematic analysis framework built on the established principles used in data mining and machine learning. The primary goal of that is to form the foundation of what we envisage will be a new recommendation system in the market. Uniquely, our strategy seeks to implement data mining tools that will allow the analyst to interact with the data and address business questions such as promotions advertisement. We employ Apriori algorithm and support vector machine to implement our recommendation systems. Experiments are done using a real market dataset and the 0.632+ bootstrap method is used here in order to evaluate our framework. The obtained results suggest that the proposed framework will be able to generate benefits for grocery chain using a real-world grocery store data.;supervised learningFeature based link prediction;Aouay et al.;2014;https://doi.org/10.1109/AICCSA.2014.7073243;Under the different searches performed to analyzing social networks, much attention has been devoted to the problem of predicting links. It is a key technique in many applications such as recommendation systems which provide suggestions of potential links between nodes. Traditional link prediction methods use a single proximity metric. In this paper, we study link prediction as a supervised learning task where we try to combine multiple features as input data for classification. To improve the accuracy of prediction, we have been applying a select attributes algorithm. Experiments have been performed on two co-authorship data sets. Results demonstrate that Random Forest, k-nearest neighbors and Principal Component Analysis yield the best performances.;supervised learningA scalable machine learning online service for big data real-time analysis;Baldominos et al.;2015;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CIBD.2014.7011537;"This work describes a proposal for developing and testing a scalable machine learning architecture able to provide real-time predictions or analytics as a service over domain-independent big data, working on top of the Hadoop ecosystem and providing real-time analytics as a service through a RESTful API. Systems implementing this architecture could provide companies with on-demand tools facilitating the tasks of storing, analyzing, understanding and reacting to their data, either in batch or stream fashion; and could turn into a valuable asset for improving the business performance and be a key market differentiator in this fast pace environment. In order to validate the proposed architecture, two systems are developed, each one providing classical machine-learning services in different domains: the first one involves a recommender system for web advertising, while the second consists in a prediction system which learns from gamers' behavior and tries to predict future events such as purchases or churning. An evaluation is carried out on these systems, and results show how both services are able to provide fast responses even when a number of concurrent requests are made, and in the particular case of the second system, results clearly prove that computed predictions significantly outperform those obtained if random guess was used.";supervised learningExperiments on synopsis-based TV program recommendation;Banerjee et al.;2012;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254199574;"In this paper, we present an empirical study to judge the importance of considering the synopsis or plot of a TV program in the design of a successful recommendation system (RS). We show that the synopsis alone can help in developing RS with reasonable performance. We investigate the dependence of recommendation performance on the size of the program synopsis. Short-plot-based recommender is found to perform better than long-plot-based recommender; however, the application of feature selection techniques helps the long-plot-based recommender perform close to the short-plot-based one. It is also noticed that applying feature selection techniques generally improves the performances of both short and long synopsis based recommender. We also compared lightweight cosine-similarity-based recommendation model with standard machine learning based models. The cosine-similarity-based model performed at par with the classifiers, thereby making the former a strong candidate for embedding recommender systems in resource-constrained devices like TV set-top box.";supervised learningImproving simple collaborative filtering models using ensemble methods;Bar et al.;2013;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-38067-9_1;In this paper we examine the effect of applying ensemble learning to the performance of collaborative filtering methods. We present several systematic approaches for generating an ensemble of collaborative filtering models based on a single collaborative filtering algorithm (single-model or homogeneous ensemble). We present an adaptation of several popular ensemble techniques in machine learning for the collaborative filtering domain, including bagging, boosting, fusion and randomness injection. We evaluate the proposed approach on several types of collaborative filtering base models: k-NN, matrix factorization and a neighborhood matrix factorization model. Empirical evaluation shows a prediction improvement compared to all base CF algorithms. In particular, we show that the performance of an ensemble of simple (weak) CF models such as k-NN is competitive compared with a single strong CF model (such as matrix factorization) while requiring an order of magnitude less computational cost.;supervised learningRecommender systems based on quantitative implicit customer feedback;Bauer & Nanopoulos;2014;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2014.09.005;Due to the abundant variety of products offered by e-commerce companies and online service providers, recommender systems become an increasingly important decision aid for customers. In this paper we focus on quantitative implicit customer feedback like sales and play records data. We extend the current state-of-the-art method for recommendations based on matrix factorization under a normal distribution assumption by allowing for different distributions which are more suitable to model this kind of data. In particular, we use the Poisson, the inverse Gaussian and the gamma distribution as extensions. The experimental evaluation with three real-world data sets shows the improved performance of our approach and we demonstrate the merit of using various distributions depending on the respective data set. We focus on quantitative implicit customer feedback like sales and play records data.We extend matrix factorization techniques by allowing for different distributions.Experimental evaluation with real datasets shows improved performance of our approach.;supervised learningDiscerning relevant model features in a content-based collaborative recommender system;Bellogin et al.;2011;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-14125-6_20;Recommender systems suggest users information items they may be interested in. User profiles or usage data are compared with some reference characteristics, which may belong to the items (content-based approach), or to other users in the same context (collaborative filtering approach). These items are usually presented as a ranking, where the more relevant an item is predicted to be for a user, the higher it appears in the ranking. In this scenario, a preferential order has to be inferred, and therefore, preference learning methods can be naturally helpful. The relevant recommendation model features for the learning-based enhancements explored in this work comprise parameters of the recommendation algorithms, and user-related attributes. In the researched approach, machine learning techniques are used to discover which model features are relevant in providing accurate recommendations. The assessment of relevant model features, which is the focus of this paper, is envisioned as the first step in a learning cycle in which improved recommendation models are produced and executed after the discovery step, based on the findings that result from it.;supervised learningContext-aware movie recommendation based on signal processing and machine learning;Biancalana et al.;2011;https://doi.org/10.1145/2096112.2096114;Most of the existing recommendation engines do not take into consideration contextual information for suggesting interesting items to users. Features such as time, location, or weather, may affect the user preferences for a particular item. In this paper, we propose two different context-aware approaches for the movie recommendation task. The first is an hybrid recommender that assesses available contextual factors related to time in order to increase the performance of traditional CF approaches. The second approach aims at identifying users in a household that submitted a given rating. This latter approach is based on machine learning techniques, namely, neural networks and majority voting classifiers. The effectiveness of both the approaches has been experimentally validated using several evaluation metrics and a large dataset.;supervised learningTowards TV recommender system: Experiments with user modeling;Bjelica;2010;https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2010.5606323;As the number of cable TV programs grows, it becomes more difficult for the viewers to find the right one. This calls for specialized recommender systems, often in a form of electronic program guides, which should provide unobtrusive assistance. In this paper, we analyze such recommender system design under the broadcast scenario, where uplink connection to the network center is not available. We put special emphasis on user modeling algorithm that would be able to efficiently learn the user's interests. Our proposal applies the elements of machine learning and pattern recognition, as well as the information retrieval theory, like vector spaces and cluster hypothesis. The derived algorithm is computationally simple, while experimental results show high acceptance ratio of the proposed recommendations.;unsupervised learningExploration / exploitation trade-off in mobile context-aware recommender systems;Bouneffouf et al.;2012;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35101-3_50;The contextual bandit problem has been studied in the recommender system community, but without paying much attention to the contextual aspect of the recommendation. We introduce in this paper an algorithm that tackles this problem by modeling the Mobile Context-Aware Recommender Systems (MCRS) as a contextual bandit algorithm and it is based on dynamic exploration/exploitation. Within a deliberately designed offline simulation framework, we conduct extensive evaluations with real online event log data. The experimental results and detailed analysis demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms surveyed algorithms.;unsupervised learningTransforming collaborative filtering into supervised learning;Braida et al.;2015;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2015.01.023;We propose an transformation from CF problem to typical supervised learning.The proposed transformation is straightforward and domain-independent.Our transformation greatly outperforms classical collaborative filtering techniques. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a well-known approach for Recommender Systems (RS). This approach extrapolates rating predictions from ratings given by user on items, which are represented by a user-item matrix filled with a rating r i , j given by an user i on an item j. Therefore, CF has been confined to this data structure relying mostly on adaptations of supervised learning methods to deal with rating predictions and matrix decomposition schemes to complete unfilled positions of the rating matrix. Although there have been proposals to apply Machine Learning (ML) to RS, these works had to transform the rating matrix into the typical Supervised Learning (SL) data set, i.e., a set of pairwise tuples ( x , y ) , where y is the correspondent class (the rating) of the instance x R k . So far, the proposed transformations were thoroughly crafted using the domain information. However, in many applications this kind of information can be incomplete, uncertain or stated in ways that are not machine-readable. Even when it is available, its usage can be very complex requiring specialists to craft the transformation. In this context, this work proposes a domain-independent transformation from the rating matrix representation to a supervised learning dataset that enables SL methods to be fully explored in RS. In addition, our transformation is said to be straightforward, in the sense that, it is an automatic process that any lay person can perform requiring no domain specialist. Our experiments have proven that our transformation, combined with SL methods, have greatly outperformed classical CF methods.;supervised learningSpecificSearch : Un outil de recommandation automatique pour la veille d’information sur le web;Brouard & Pomot;2016;https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01384957;The main function of content-based automatic recommendation systems is to propose information likely to interest a user on the basis of the relevance feedback that the user has previously given on other information. Different machine learning algorithms have been integrated into information retrieval systems to propose solutions to perform this task. However, these solutions have not led to automatic recommendation systems for the web accessible to all. RSS feed aggregators exist to gather information on the web, but systems integrating learning are still in their infancy. We present here the functionalities and the architecture of a web application named SpecificSearch accessible online which is presented as an RSS feed aggregator integrating a learning system. A first evaluation shows the feasibility and usefulness of such a system.;supervised learningHybrid neural architecture for intelligent recommender system classification unit design;Buabin;2012;https://doi.org/10.4018/978-1-4666-2542-6.ch010;The objective is intelligent recommender system classification unit design using hybrid neural techniques. In particular, a neuroscience-based hybrid neural by Buabin (2011a) is introduced, explained, and examined for its potential in real world text document classification on the modapte version of the Reuters news text corpus. The so described neuroscience model (termed Hy-RNC) is fully integrated with a novel boosting algorithm to augment text document classification purposes. Hy-RNC outperforms existing works and opens up an entirely new research field in the area of machine learning. The main contribution of this book chapter is the provision of a step-by-step approach to modeling the hybrid system using underlying concepts such as boosting algorithms, recurrent neural networks, and hybrid neural systems. Results attained in the experiments show impressive performance by the hybrid neural classifier even with a minimal number of neurons in constituting structures.;supervised learningPredicting user behavior in electronic markets based on personality-mining in large online social networks: A personality-based product recommender framework;Buettner;2016;https://doi.org/10.1007/s12525-016-0228-z;Determining a user’s preferences is an important condition for effectively operating automatic recommendation systems. Since personality theory claims that a user’s personality substantially influences preference, I propose a personality-based product recommender (PBPR) framework to analyze social media data in order to predict a user’s personality and to subsequently derive its personality-based product preferences. The PBRS framework will be evaluated as an IT-artefact with a unique online social network XING dataset and a unique coffeemaker preference dataset. My evaluation results show (a) the possibility of predicting a user’s personality from social media data, as I reached a predictive gain between 23.2 and 41.8 percent and (b) the possibility of recommending products based on a user’s personality, as I reached a predictive gain of 45.1 percent.;unsupervised learningLearning collaborative filtering and its application to people to people recommendation in social networks;Cai et al.;2010;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2010.159;"Predicting people who other people may like has recently become an important task in many online social networks. Traditional collaborative filtering (CF) approaches are popular in recommender systems to effectively predict user preferences for items. One major problem in CF is computing similarity between users or items. Traditional CF methods often use heuristic methods to combine the ratings given to an item by similar users, which may not reflect the characteristics of the active user and can give unsatisfactory performance. In contrast to heuristic approaches we have developed CollabNet, a novel algorithm that uses gradient descent to learn the relative contributions of similar users or items to the ranking of recommendations produced by a recommender system, using weights to represent the contributions of similar users for each active user. We have applied CollabNet to the challenging prob-lem of people to people recommendation in social networks, where people have a dual role as both ""users"" and ""items"", e.g., both initiating and receiving communications, to recommend other users to a given user, based on user similarity in terms of both taste (whom they like) and attractiveness (who likes them). Evaluation of CollabNet recommendations on datasets from a commercial online social network shows improved performance over standard CF.";supervised learningReciprocal and heterogeneous link prediction in social networks;Cai et al.;2012;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-30220-6_17;Link prediction is a key technique in many applications in social networks, where potential links between entities need to be predicted. Conventional link prediction techniques deal with either homogeneous entities, e.g., people to people, item to item links, or non-reciprocal relationships, e.g., people to item links. However, a challenging problem in link prediction is that of heterogeneous and reciprocal link prediction, such as accurate prediction of matches on an online dating site, jobs or workers on employment websites, where the links are reciprocally determined by both entities that heterogeneously belong to disjoint groups. The nature and causes of interactions in these domains makes heterogeneous and reciprocal link prediction significantly different from the conventional version of the problem. In this work, we address these issues by proposing a novel learnable framework called ReHeLP, which learns heterogeneous and reciprocal knowledge from collaborative information and demonstrate its impact on link prediction. Evaluation on a large commercial online dating dataset shows the success of the proposed method and its promise for link prediction.;supervised learningTRTML - A tripleset recommendation tool based on supervised learning algorithms;Caraballo et al.;2014;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-11955-7_58;The Linked Data initiative promotes the publication of interlinked RDF triplesets, thereby creating a global scale data space. However, to enable the creation of such data space, the publisher of a tripleset t must be aware of other triplesets that he can interlink with t. Towards this end, this paper describes a Web-based application, called TRTML, that explores metadata available in Linked Data catalogs to provide data publishers with recommendations of related triplesets. TRTML combines supervised learning algorithms and link prediction measures to provide recommendations. The evaluation of the tool adopted as ground truth a set of links obtained from metadata stored in the DataHub catalog. The high precision and recall results demonstrate the usefulness of TRTML.;supervised learningEnhancing stakeholder profiles to improve recommendations in online requirements elicitation;Castro-Herrera et al.;2009;https://doi.org/10.1109/RE.2009.20;Requirements elicitation has long been recognized as a crucial activity in any software development project. Unfortunately, the traditional elicitation practices do not scale well when applied to larger projects, where knowledge is distributed across numerous geographically dispersed stakeholders. As a result, new distributed requirements elicitation tools have started to surface, such as online forums and wiki pages. In our previous work, we introduced a framework for supporting distributed elicitation by utilizing data mining and machine learning techniques to automatically group stakeholder ideas into forums, and by using recommender system technologies to help promote these forums to potentially interested stakeholders. The framework is designed to create an open and more inclusive environment where points of view, conflicts, interests and tradeoffs are identified as early as possible. In this paper, we present two substantial enhancements to the Recommender System component of this framework, and demonstrate through experiments how they improve the quality of the recommendations.;supervised learningContext and intention-awareness in POIs recommender systems;Costa et al.;2012;https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.726.7865;This paper describes an agent-based approach for making context and intention-aware recommendations of Points of Interest (POI). A two-parted agent architecture was used, with an agent responsible for gathering POIs from a location-based mobile application, and a set of Personal Assistant Agents (PAA), collecting information about the context and intentions of its respective user. Each PAA includes a probabilistic classifier for making recommendations given its information about the user's context and intentions. Supervised, incremental learning occurs when the feedback of the true relevance of each recommendation is given by the user to his PAA. To evaluate the system's recommendations, we performed an experiment based on the profile used in the training process, using different locations, contexts and goals.;supervised learningRecommending POIs based on the user’s context and intentions;Costa et al.;2013;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-38061-7_17;This paper describes a Recommender System that implements a Multiagent System for making personalised context and intention-aware recommendations of Points of Interest (POIs). A two-parted agent architecture was used, with an agent responsible for gathering POIs from a location-based service, and a set of Personal Assistant Agents (PAAs) collecting information about the context and intentions of its respective user. In each PAA were embedded four Machine Learning algorithms, with the purpose of ascertaining how well-suited these classifiers are for filtering irrelevant POIs, in a completely automatic fashion. Supervised, incremental learning occurs when the feedback on the true relevance of each recommendation is given by the user to his PAA. To evaluate the recommendations’ accuracy, we performed an experiment considering three types of users, using different contexts and intentions. As a result, all the PAA had high accuracy, revealing in specific situations F 1 scores higher than 87%.;supervised learningA meta-learning framework for algorithm recommendation in software fault prediction;Das Dôres et al.;2016;https://doi.org/10.1145/2851613.2851788;Software fault prediction is a significant part of software quality assurance and it is commonly used to detect faulty software modules based on software measurement data. Several machine learning based approaches have been proposed for generating predictive models from collected data, although none has become standard given the specificities of each software project. Hence, we believe that recommending the best algorithm for each project is much more important and useful than developing a single algorithm for being used in any project. For achieving that goal, we propose in this paper a novel framework for recommending machine learning algorithms that is capable of automatically identifying the most suitable algorithm according to the software project that is being considered. Our solution, namely SFP-MLF, makes use of the meta-learning paradigm in order to learn the best learner for a particular project. Results show that the SFP-MLF framework provides both the best single algorithm recommendation and also the best ranking recommendation for the software fault prediction problem.;supervised learningIntegrating tags in a semantic content-based recommender;De Gemmis et al.;2008;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1454008.1454036;"Basic content personalization consists in matching up the attributes of a user profile, in which preferences and interests are stored, with the attributes of a content object. The Web 2.0 (r)evolution and the advent of user generated content have changed the game for personalization, since the role of people has evolved from passive consumers of information to that of active contributors. One of the forms of user generated content that has drawn more attention from the research community is folksonomy, a taxonomy generated by users who collaboratively annotate and categorize resources of interests with freely chosen keywords called tags. In this paper, we investigate whether folksonomies might be a valuable source of information about user interests. The main contribution is a strategy that enables a content-based recommender to infer user interests by applying machine learning techniques both on the ""official"" item descriptions provided by a publisher, and on tags which users adopt to freely annotate relevant items. Static content and tags are preventively analyzed by advanced linguistic techniques in order to capture the semantics of the user interests often hidden behind keywords. The proposed approach has been evaluated in the context of cultural heritage personalization. Preliminary experiments involving 30 real users show an improvement in the predictive accuracy of the tag-augmented recommender compared to the pure content-based one.";supervised learningA content-collaborative recommender that exploits WordNet-based user profiles for neighborhood formation;Degemmis et al.;2007;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11257-006-9023-4;Collaborative and content-based filtering are the recommendation techniques most widely adopted to date. Traditional collaborative approaches compute a similarity value between the current user and each other user by taking into account their rating style, that is the set of ratings given on the same items. Based on the ratings of the most similar users, commonly referred to as neighbors, collaborative algorithms compute recommendations for the current user. The problem with this approach is that the similarity value is only computable if users have common rated items. The main contribution of this work is a possible solution to overcome this limitation. We propose a new content-collaborative hybrid recommender which computes similarities between users relying on their content-based profiles, in which user preferences are stored, instead of comparing their rating styles. In more detail, user profiles are clustered to discover current user neighbors. Content-based user profiles play a key role in the proposed hybrid recommender. Traditional keyword-based approaches to user profiling are unable to capture the semantics of user interests. A distinctive feature of our work is the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles representing user interests in a more effective way, compared to classical keyword-based profiles, due to a sense-based indexing. Semantic profiles are obtained by integrating machine learning algorithms for text categorization, namely a nave Bayes approach and a relevance feedback method, with a word sense disambiguation strategy based exclusively on the lexical knowledge stored in the WordNet lexical database. Experiments carried out on a content-based extension of the EachMovie dataset show an improvement of the accuracy of sense-based profiles with respect to keyword-based ones, when coping with the task of classifying movies as interesting (or not) for the current user. An experimental session has been also performed in order to evaluate the proposed hybrid recommender system. The results highlight the improvement in the predictive accuracy of collaborative recommendations obtained by selecting like-minded users according to user profiles.;unsupervised learningSmoothing approach to alleviate the meager rating problem in collaborative recommender systems;Devi & Venkatesh;2013;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2011.05.011;In this paper, an integrated recommendation approach using Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) and Collaborative Filtering (CF) is proposed. Radial basis function network is a neural network approximation method used to improve the accuracy of the recommendations. The proposed system RBFN_KFCM has offline and online phases. During offline, the system uses RBFN for smoothing and kernel fuzzy c-means (KFCM) method for clustering. During online recommendation, KFCM based approach is proposed. At the end of each session the clusters are updated by replacing the smoothed rating by the original rating. A comparison is made with benchmark recommender systems such as item-based, user-based systems, singular value decomposition (SVD) and also popular machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) using backpropagation algorithm, in terms of accuracy, decision-support measures and computational time. Empirical evaluation is carried out by using movielens dataset.;unsupervised learningExploration of methodologies to improve job recommender systems on social networks;Diaby et al.;2014;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13278-014-0227-z;"This paper presents content-based recommender systems which propose relevant jobs to Facebook and LinkedIn users.

The first experiments suggest that to predict the interests of users for jobs using basic similarity measures together with data collected by Work4 can be improved upon. The next experiments then propose a method to estimate the importance of users’ and jobs’ different fields in the task of job recommendation; taking into account these weights allow us to significantly improve the recommendations.

A variant of this recommender system is currently used by Work4, a San Francisco-based software company that offers Facebook recruitment solutions. Work4 is the world leader in social recruitment technology; to use its applications, Facebook or LinkedIn users explicitly grant access to some parts of their data, and they are presented with the jobs whose descriptions are matching their profiles the most. The profile of a user contains two types of data: interactions data (user's own data) and social connections data (user's friends data). Furthermore the users profiles and the description of jobs are divided into several parts called fields. Our experiments suggest that to predict the users interests for jobs, using basic similarity measures together with their interactions data collected by Work4 can be improved upon. The second part of this study presents a method to estimate the importance of each field of users and jobs in the task of job recommendation.

In such architecture, each client corresponds to an individual learning task and the associated dataset of examples. The goal of the architecture is to perform information fusion from multiple datasets while preserving privacy of individual data. The role of the server is to collect data in real time from the clients and codify the information in a common database. Such information can be used by all the clients to solve their individual learning task, so that each client can exploit the information content of all the datasets without actually having access to private data of others. The proposed algorithmic framework, based on regularization and kernel methods, uses a suitable class of ""mixed effect"" kernels. The methodology is illustrated through a simulated recommendation system, as well as an experiment involving pharmacological data coming from a multicentric clinical trial.";supervised learningTRUPI: Twitter recommendation based on users’ personal interests;Elmongui et al.;2015;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-18117-2_20;Twitter has emerged as one of the most powerful micro-blogging services for real-time sharing of information on the web. The large volume of posts in several topics is overwhelming to twitter users who might be interested in only few topics. To this end, we propose TRUPI, a personalized recommendation system for the timelines of twitter users where tweets are ranked by the user’s personal interests. The proposed system combines the user social features and interactions as well as the history of her tweets content to attain her interests. The system captures the users interests dynamically by modeling them as a time variant in different topics to accommodate the change of these interests over time. More specifically, we combine a set of machine learning and natural language processing techniques to analyze the topics of the various tweets posted on the user’s timeline and rank them based on her dynamically detected interests. Our extensive performance evaluation on a publicly available dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of TRUPI and shows that it outperforms the competitive state of the art by 25% on nDCG@25, and 14% on MAP.;unsupervised learningLearning to predict ad clicks based on boosted collaborative filtering;T.-K.

As social network services (e.g., Facebook and Morgenstern) are becoming the main platform for social activities, more than 20% of online advertisements appear on social network sites. The allocation of advertisements based on both individual information and social relationships is becoming ever more important. In this study, we first propose the notion of social filtering and compare it with content-based filtering and collaborative filtering for advertisement allocation in a social network. Second, we apply content-boosted and social-boosted methods to enhance existing collaborating filtering models. Finally, an effective learning-based framework is proposed to combine filtering models to improve social advertising. The experiments are conducted based on datasets collected from a social finance web site called Morgenstern. We performed a series of comparison experiments between filtering approaches. The experimental results indicate that the learning-based framework is able to achieve better performance results than fundamental filtering and boosted filtering mechanisms alone.;supervised learningA Text Clustering Approach of Chinese News Based on Neural Network Language Model;Z. Fan et al.;2016;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10766-014-0329-2;Text clustering plays an important role in data mining and machine learning. After years of development, clustering technology has produced a series of theories and methods. However, in the text clustering of Chinese news, the mainstream LDA method suffers a high time complex. In order to improve the speed, this paper puts forward a new method in which neural network language model is first applied to text clustering. Text clustering is first converted to its dual problem called word clustering. With neural network language model, we can get word vector which can be used in the fuzzy k-means of the Chinese news keyword set. Based on the keyword clustering result, we can get text clustering result of Chinese news by a single transition. Experiments have show this method's running speed is five times faster than LDA. This method has been successfully used in the Sohu news recommendation system currently.;unsupervised learningEffective page recommendation algorithms based on distributed learning automata and weighted association rules;Forsati & Meybodi;2010;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2009.06.010;Different efforts have been done to address the problem of information overload on the Internet. Recommender systems aim at directing users through this information space, toward the resources that best meet their needs and interests by extracting knowledge from the previous users’ interactions. In this paper, we propose three algorithms to solve the web page recommendation problem. In our first algorithm, we use distributed learning automata to learn the behavior of previous users’ and recommend pages to the current user based on learned patterns. By introducing a novel weighted association rule mining algorithm, we present our second algorithm for recommendation purpose. Also, a novel method is proposed to pure the current session window. One of the challenging problems in recommendation systems is dealing with unvisited or newly added pages. By considering this problem and improving the efficiency of first two algorithms we present a hybrid algorithm based on distributed learning automata and proposed weighted association rule mining algorithm. In the hybrid algorithm we employ the HITS algorithm to extend the recommendation set. Our experiments on real data set show that the hybrid algorithm performs better than the other algorithms we compared to and, at the same time, it is less complex than other proposed algorithms with respect to memory usage and computational cost too.;supervised learningEffective page recommendation algorithms based on distributed learning automata;Forsati et al.;2009;https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCGI.2009.14;Different efforts have been done to address the problem of information overload on the Internet.

The most popular approaches to retrieve the most relevant items for a user are collaborative filtering (CF) recommendation algorithms and in particular in recent years a number of sophisticated algorithms based, e.g., on matrix factorization or machine learning, have been proposed to improve the predictive accuracy of RS. In our recent work, we proposed a novel recommendation scheme called RF-Rec, which generates predictions simply by counting and combining the frequencies of the different rating values in the usual user-item rating matrix. The scheme has some key advantages when compared with more sophisticated techniques. It is trivial to implement, can generate predictions in constant time and has a high prediction coverage. In this paper we propose extensions to our method in order to further increase the predictive accuracy by introducing schemes to weight and parameterize the components of the predictor. An evaluation on three standard test data sets reveals that the accuracy of our new schemes is higher than traditional CF algorithms in particular on sparse data sets and on a par with a recent matrix factorization algorithm. At the same time, the key advantages of the basic scheme such as computational efficiency, scalability, simplicity and the support for incremental updates are still maintained.;supervised learningLearning image and user features for recommendation in social networks;Geng et al.;2016;https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2015.486;Good representations of data do help in many machine learning tasks such as recommendation. It is often a great challenge for traditional recommender systems to learn representative features of both users and images in large social networks, in particular, social curation networks, which are characterized as the extremely sparse links between users and images, and the extremely diverse visual contents of images. To address the challenges, we propose a novel deep model which learns the unified feature representations for both users and images. This is done by transforming the heterogeneous user-image networks into homogeneous low-dimensional representations, which facilitate a recommender to trivially recommend images to users by feature similarity. We also develop a fast online algorithm that can be easily scaled up to large networks in an asynchronously parallel way. We conduct extensive experiments on a representative subset of Pinterest, containing 1,456,540 images and 1,000,000 users. Results of image recommendation experiments demonstrate that our feature learning approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art recommendation methods.;supervised learningEnhancing memory-based collaborative filtering for group recommender systems;Ghazarian & Nematbakhsh;2015;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2014.11.042;Memory-based collaborating filtering techniques are widely used in recommender systems. They are based on full initial ratings in a user-item matrix. However, most of the time in group recommender systems, this matrix is sparse and users’ preferences are unknown. This deficiency may make memory-based collaborative filtering unsuitable for group recommender systems. This paper, improves memory-based techniques for group recommendation systems by resolving the data sparsity problem. The core of the proposed method is based on a support vector machine learning model that computes similarities between items. This method employs calculated similarities and enhances basic memory-based techniques. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method overcomes the memory-based techniques. It also indicates that the presented work outperforms the latent factor approach, which is very efficient in sparse conditions. Finally, it is indicated that the proposed method gives a better performance than existing approaches on generating group recommendations.;unsupervised learningAutomatic query reformulations for text retrieval in software engineering;Haiduc et al.;2013;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2013.6606630;There are more than twenty distinct software engineering tasks addressed with text retrieval (TR) techniques, such as, traceability link recovery, feature location, refactoring, reuse, etc. A common issue with all TR applications is that the results of the retrieval depend largely on the quality of the query. When a query performs poorly, it has to be reformulated and this is a difficult task for someone who had trouble writing a good query in the first place. We propose a recommender (called Refoqus) based on machine learning, which is trained with a sample of queries and relevant results. Then, for a given query, it automatically recommends a reformulation strategy that should improve its performance, based on the properties of the query. We evaluated Refoqus empirically against four baseline approaches that are used in natural language document retrieval. The data used for the evaluation corresponds to changes from five open source systems in Java and C++ and it is used in the context of TR-based concept location in source code. Refoqus outperformed the baselines and its recommendations lead to query performance improvement or preservation in 84% of the cases (in average).;supervised learningAn entertainment recommendation system using the dynamics of user behavior over time;Halder et al.;2014;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICCITechn.2014.7073094;Personalized entertainment items recommendation is required to help millions of people narrow the universe of potential items to fit their unique tastes. These services usually depend on a machine-learning algorithm, which breaks down items into long lists of attributes and matches these elements to a user's preferences. A set of such algorithms have been proposed. Most of these, such as collaborative filtering, works by finding a group of users based on the item he/she buys or provides feedback and then recommend popular items in the group. In this paper we argue that relying only on such acts are not sufficient for an effective recommendation system, we need to consider other things, such as, an entertainment item enjoying time since it could change over the course time. In this paper we proposed a novel algorithm to find a group of user that usage not only the ratings but also the time of the given ratings. Additionally, we propose algorithms for recommending items to the producers such that they can entertain us more. We perform experiments to validate the performance of our system. We show that our system outperforms in comparison with the existing algorithms.;unsupervised learningSelf-optimizing a clustering-based tag recommender for social bookmarking systems;Hassan et al.;2010;https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2010.93;"In this paper, we propose and evaluate a self-optimization strategy for a clustering-based tag recommendation system. For tag recommendation, we use an efficient discriminative clustering approach. To develop our self-optimization strategy for this tag recommendation approach, we empirically investigate when and how to update the tag recommender with minimum human intervention. We present a nonlinear optimization model whose solution yields the clustering parameters that maximize the recommendation accuracy within an administrator specified time window. Evaluation on ""BibSonomy'' data produces promising results. For example, by using our self-optimization strategy a 6% increase in average F1 score is achieved when the administrator allows up to 2% drop in average F1 score in the last one thousand recommendations.";supervised learningCollaborative Filtering via Gaussian Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis;Hofmann;2003;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/860435.860483;Collaborative filtering aims at learning predictive models of user preferences, interests or behavior from community data, i.e. a database of available user preferences. In this paper, we describe a new model-based algorithm designed for this task, which is based on a generalization of probabilistic latent semantic analysis to continuous-valued response variables. More specifically, we assume that the observed user ratings can be modeled as a mixture of user communities or interest groups, where users may participate probabilistically in one or more groups. Each community is characterized by a Gaussian distribution on the normalized ratings for each item. The normalization of ratings is performed in a user-specific manner to account for variations in absolute shift and variance of ratings. Experiments on the EachMovie data set show that the proposed approach compares favorably with other collaborative filtering techniques.;supervised learningLatent semantic models for collaborative filtering;Hofmann;2004;https://doi.org/10.1145/963770.963774;Collaborative filtering aims at learning predictive models of user preferences, interests or behavior from community data, that is, a database of available user preferences. In this article, we describe a new family of model-based algorithms designed for this task. These algorithms rely on a statistical modelling technique that introduces latent class variables in a mixture model setting to discover user communities and prototypical interest profiles. We investigate several variations to deal with discrete and continuous response variables as well as with different objective functions. The main advantages of this technique over standard memory-based methods are higher accuracy, constant time prediction, and an explicit and compact model representation. The latter can also be used to mine for user communitites. The experimental evaluation shows that substantial improvements in accucracy over existing methods and published results can be obtained.;supervised learningTwo algorithms under stochastic gradient descent framework for recommender systems;Huang & Nikulin;2014;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-13186-3_21;The Recommender System (RS) is a subfield of machine learning that aims in creating algorithms to predict user preferences based on known user ratings or user behavior in selecting or purchasing items. Such a system has great importance in applications to sport, marketing and education. In the last case, we are interested to improve state of the art in student evaluation by predicting whether a student will answer the next question correctly. This prediction will help student to get right orientation which learning area should to be given greater attention. Note that the available data are given in the form of list, but not in the traditional form of matrix. Consequently, standard factorization technique is not applicable here. However, stochastic gradient methods work well with the lists of data, where the most of relations are missing, and maybe required to be predicted. In this paper we consider optimization of the most important regulation parameters, such as numbers of factors, learning and regularization rates, numbers of global iterations. Our study is based on the Grockit and Chess data, which were used online during popular data mining contests on the platform Kaggle.;supervised learningA novel ontology and machine learning inspired hybrid cardiovascular decision support framework;Hussain et al.;2015;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SSCI.2015.122;Healthcare information management systems (HIMS) have a substantial amount of limitations such as rigidity and nonconformity to complex clinical processes like Electronic Healthcare records and effective utilisation of clinical practice guidelines to help provide effective clinical decision support. The conventional healthcare systems suffer from a general lack of intelligence, they are successful in offering basic patient management capabilities, but they do not offer consistent and holistic decision support capabilities for clinicians working under tight deadlines in a fast paced environment. The conventional healthcare information management systems are designed using branching logic based rigid architectures, which are hard to maintain and upgrade without considerable labour intensive effort. The proposed ontology and machine learning driven hybrid clinical decision support framework comprises of two key components (1) ontology driven clinical risk assessment and recommendation system and (2) machine learning driven prognostic system. The key aim of our research is to utilise information collected through the knowledge based ontology driven clinical risk assessment and recommendation system and non-knowledge based/evidence based machine learning driven prognostic system to deliver a holistic clinical decision support framework in the cardiovascular domain. The ontology driven clinical risk assessment and recommendation system could be used as a triage system for cardiovascular patients as a preventative solution, this could help clinicians prioritise patient referrals after reviewing a snapshot of patient's medical history (collected through an ontology driven intelligent context aware information collection using standardised clinical questionnaires) containing patient demographics information, cardiac risk scores, cardiac chest pain score, medication and recommended lab tests details. The machine learning driven prognostic system is developed using a chest pain clinical case study identified by the consultant cardiologist, Professor Stephen Leslie from Raigmore Hospital in Inverness. The key aim of this clinical case study UK is to provide a clinical decision support mechanism for Raigmore Hospital's Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic (RACPC) patients by combining evidence, extrapolated through legacy patient data (based on machine learning driven techniques) to facilitate evidence based cardiovascular preventative care. The machine learning driven prognostic system provides cardiac chest pain prognosis through a cardiac chest pain specific prognostic model which is validated through consultant cardiologist from Raigmore Hospital. The cardiac chest pain prognostic model could help clinicians diagnose cardiac chest pain patients efficiently and could also help clinicians reduce load on overly prescribed angiography treatment in a cost effective manner. Additional two clinical case studies in the heart disease and breast cancer domains are considered for the development and clinical validation of the machine learning driven prognostic system. The proposed novel ontology and machine learning driven hybrid clinical decision support framework will also be validated in other application areas.;supervised learningPersonalized recommender system on whom to follow in twitter;Islam et al.;2015;https://doi.org/10.1109/BDCloud.2014.84;Recommender systems have been widely used in social network sites. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to recommend new followees to Twitter users by learning their historic friends-adding patterns. Based on a user's past social graph and her interactions with other users, scores based on some of the commonly used recommendation strategies are calculated and passed into the learning machine along with the recently added list of followees of the user. Learning to rank algorithm then identifies the best combination of recommendation strategies the user adopted to add new followees in the past. Although users may not adopt any recommendation strategies explicitly, they may subconsciously or implicitly use some. If the actually added followees match with the ones suggested by the recommendation strategy, we consider users are implicitly using that strategy. The experiment using the real data collected from Twitter proves the effectiveness of the proposed approach. ;supervised learningA Web recommendation system based on maximum entropy;Jin et al.;2005;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ITCC.2005.53;In this paper, we propose a Web recommendation system based on a maximum entropy model. Under the maximum entropy principle, multiple sources of knowledge about users' navigational behavior in a Web site can be seamlessly combined to discover usage patterns and to automatically generate the most effective recommendations for new users with similar profiles. In this paper we integrate the knowledge from page-level clickstream statistics about users' past navigations with the aggregate usage patterns discovered through Web usage mining. Our experiment results show that our method can achieve better prediction accuracy when compared to standard recommendation approaches, while providing a better interpretation of Web users' diverse navigational behaviors.;supervised learningWeb usage mining using support vector machine;Jun;2005;https://doi.org/10.1007/11494669_43;The web contains rich and dynamic collections of hyperlink information, web page access, and usage information providing rich sources for data mining. From this, we need a system to recommend a visitor good information. This recommendation system can be constructed by web usage mining process. The web usage mining mines web log records to discover user access patterns of web pages. Also it is the application of data mining techniques to large web log data in order to extract usage patterns from user's click streams. In general, the size of web log records is so large that we have difficulty to analyze web log data. To make matter worse, the web log records are very sparse. So it is very hard to estimate the dependency between the web pages. In this paper, we solved this difficulty of web usage mining using support vector machine. In the experiments, we verified our proposed method by given data from UCI machine learning repository and KDD cup 2000. ;supervised learningUser preference mining through hybrid collaborative filtering and content-based filtering in recommendation system;Jung & Lee;2004;https://search.ieice.org/bin/summary.php?id=e87-d_12_2781;The growth of the Internet has resulted in an increasing need for personalized information systems. The paper describes an autonomous agent, the Web Robot Agent or WebBot, which integrates with the web and acts as a personal recommendation system that cooperates with the user in order to identify interesting pages. The Apriori algorithm extracts the characteristics of the web pages in the form of association words that are semantically related and mines a bag of association words. Using hybrid components from collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, this hybrid recommendation system can overcome the shortcomings associated with traditional recommendation systems. In this paper, we present an improved recommendation system, which uses the user preference mining through hybrid 2-way filtering. The proposed method was tested on a database, and its effectiveness compared with existent methods was proven in on-line experiments.;supervised learningA multi-stage learning framework for intelligent system;Kao & Fahn;2013;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2012.12.046;As information technologies advance and user-friendly interfaces develop, the interaction between humans and computers, information devices, and new consumer electronics is increasingly gaining attention. One example that most people can relate to is Apple’s innovation in human–computer interaction which has been used on many products such as iPod and iPhone. Siri, the intelligent personal assistant, is a typical application of machine-learning human–computer interaction.Algorithms in machine learning have been employed in many disciplines, including gesture recognition, speaker recognition, and product recommendation systems. While the existing learning algorithms compute and learn from a large quantity of data, this study proposes an improved learning to rank algorithm named MultiStageBoost. In addition to ranking data through multiple stages, the MultiStageBoost algorithm significantly improves the existing algorithms in two ways. Firstly, it classifies and filters data to small quantities and applies the Boosting algorithm to achieve faster ranking performance. Secondly, it enhances the original binary classification by using the reciprocal of fuzzily weighted membership as the ranking distance.The importance of data is revealed in their ranked positions. Usually data ranked in the front are given more attention than those ranked in the middle. For example, after ranking 10,000 pieces of data, the top 10, or at most 100, are the most important and relevant. Whether the data after the top ones are ranked precisely does not really matter. Due to this reason, this study has made improvement on the conventional methods of the pair-wise ranking approach. Not only are data classified and ranked binarily, they are also given different weights depending on whether they are concordant or discordant. Incorporating the concept of weighting into the ranking distance allows us to increase the precision of ranking. Results from experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional methods in three evaluation measures: P@n, MAP, and NDCG. MultiStageBoost was then applied to speech recognition. However, we do not aim to improve the technology of speech recognition, but simply hope to provide evidences that MultiStageBoost can be used in the classification and ranking in speech recognition. Experiments show that the recognition optimization procedures established by this study are able to increase the recognition rate to over 95% in the personal computing device and industrial personal computer. It is expected that in the future this voice management system will accurately and effectively identify speakers answering the voice response questionnaire and will successfully carry out the functions in the choice of answers, paying the way for the formation of a virtual customer service person.;supervised learningFeature enhanced time-aware recommender system;Karahodza & Donko;2015;https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAT.2015.7340527;Traditional recommender systems utilize user and item profiles in order to predict ratings of unseen items. New users, items and ratings are continuously updated to the system, making data available for detection of changes in user preferences throughout the time. In this work the widely used user-neighborhood recommender system is extended by incorporating temporal information and enhancing measure of neighborhood similarity with information on item features. Unlike other models, we also add time-weight function in the preference prediction step to improve prediction accuracy. Experiments on real data set show an improvement in prediction performance over traditional collaborative filtering model.;supervised learningMinimal shrinkage for noisy data recovery using Schatten-p norm objective;Kong et al.;2013;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-40991-2_12;Noisy data recovery is an important problem in machine learning field, which has widely applications for collaborative prediction, recommendation systems, etc. One popular model is to use trace norm model for noisy data recovery. However, it is ignored that the reconstructed data could be shrank (i.e., singular values could be greatly suppressed). In this paper, we present novel noisy data recovery models, which replaces the standard rank constraint (i.e., trace norm) using Schatten-p Norm. The proposed model is attractive due to its suppression on the shrinkage of singular values at smaller parameter p. We analyze the optimal solution of proposed models, and characterize the rank of optimal solution. Efficient algorithms are presented, the convergences of which are rigorously proved. Extensive experiment results on 6 noisy datasets demonstrate the good performance of proposed minimum shrinkage models.;supervised learningActive learning for technology enhanced learning;Krohn-Grimberghe et al.;2011;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-23985-4_48;Suggesting tasks and learning resources of appropriate difficulty to learners is challenging. Neither should they be too difficult and nor too easy. Well-chosen tasks would enable a quick assessment of the learner, well-chosen learning resources would speed up the learning curve most. We connect active learning to classical pedagogical theory and propose the uncertainty sampling framework as a means to the challenge of selecting optimal tasks and learning resources to learners. To assess the efficiency of this strategy, we compared different exercise selection strategies and evaluated their effect on different datasets. We consistently find that uncertainty sampling significantly outperforms several alternative exercise selection approaches and thus leads to a faster convergence to the true assessment. These findings demonstrate that active (machine) learning is consistent with classic learning theory. It is a valuable instrument for choosing appropriate exercises as well as learning resources both from a teacher’s and from a learner’s perspective.;supervised learningCollaborative filtering for people-to-people recommendation in online dating: Data analysis and user trial;Krzywicki et al.;2015;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2014.12.003;A common perception is that online dating systems “match” people on the basis of profiles containing demographic and psychographic information and/or user interests. In contrast, product recommender systems are typically based on collaborative filtering, suggesting purchases not based on “content” but on the purchases of “similar” users. In this paper, we study collaborative filtering for people-to-people recommendation in online dating, comparing this approach to a baseline profile matching method. Initial data analysis highlights the problem of over-recommending popular users, a standard problem for collaborative filtering applied to product recommendation, but more acute in people-to-people recommendation. We address this problem with a two-stage recommender process that employs a Decision Tree derived from interactions data as a “critic” to re-rank candidates generated by collaborative filtering. Our baseline profile matching method dynamically chooses, for each user, attributes that contribute most significantly to successful interactions with candidates having the best matching attribute value. The key evaluation metric is success rate improvement, the increase in the chance of a user having a successful interaction when acting on recommendations. Our methods were first evaluated on historical data from a large online dating site and then trialled live over a 9 week period providing recommendations via e-mail to a large number of users. The trial confirmed the consistency of the analysis on historical data and the ability of our collaborative filtering method to generate suitable candidates over an extended period. Moreover, the collaborative filtering method gives a higher success rate improvement than profile matching.;supervised learningCustomising WAP-based information services on mobile networks;W.-P. Lee & Lu;2003;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00779-003-0247-6;In addition to voice transmission over mobile networks, the demand of data communication has been increasing. To deploy data-oriented applications for mobile terminals, the wireless application protocol (WAP) has provided a promising solution. However, as in the World Wide Web (WWW), the increasing information leads to the problem of information overload. One way to overcome such a problem is to build intelligent recommender systems to provide customised information services. By analyzing the information collected from the user, a customised recommender system is able to reason his personal preferences and to build a model of predictions. In this way, only the information predicted as user-interested can reach the end user. This paper presents a multi-agent framework in which a decision tree-based approach is employed to learn a user’s preferences. To assess the proposed framework, a mobile phone simulator is used to represent a mobile environment and a series of experiments are conducted. The experimental studies have concentrated on how to recommend appropriate information to the individual user, and on how the system can adapt to a user’s most recent preferences. The results and analysis show that based on our framework the WAP-based customised information services can be successfully performed.;supervised learningEasy-to-explain feature synthesis approach for recommending entertainment video;T.-J. Lee & Tseng;2012;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2011.09.034;The use of dimension reduction techniques has attracted considerable attention owing to information explosion. Without considering the underlying phenomena of interest, traditional dimension reduction approaches aim to search a feature set for optimizing performance. In recommending entertainment videos, beyond the successful recommendations, marketing strategy can be benefited from interpreting precise social context information accurately. Therefore, how to find an easy-to-explain feature set to achieve optimal prediction performance becomes an important issue. In this paper, we propose a three-phase feature synthesis approach to search heuristically optimal feature set within exponential easy-to-explain features. The first phase performs feature selection by screening low-informative features, the second phase shrinks the high-dependent feature subset, and the third phase enhances the dominated features. An implemented social recommendation system and the 11 months purchasing data from the largest commercial entertainment video Web shop in Taiwan are adopted to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed feature synthesis method in the experiments. The experimental results show that our approach can obtain the interpretable clustering results as well as improve the recommendation.;unsupervised learningEvaluating software quality in use using user reviews mining;Leopairote et al.;2013;https://doi.org/10.1109/JCSSE.2013.6567355;Reviews of software from experienced users play an important role for software acquisition decision. In order to share their experiences, an online software recommendation system has been developed. This information is not only useful for users or customers, but it is also be used for evaluating the software. Since there are many of reviews are accumulated and expressed in both formal and informal written languages, it takes time for concluding the evaluation. Therefore, we are interested in an automatically process to extract software information attributes from the reviews in order to provide software review representation. One essential problem is the different sentiment of the same sentence in different environment. To solve this problem, rule-based classification is used as our machine learning model. In this research, software quality extracted from user perspective with respect to ISO 9126 is selected to be the characteristic model. We also propose a methodology for a software product reviews mining based on software quality ontology and a product software quality in use scores for software review representation. Our classification approach is applied from two lists of sentiment words (positive and negative words) combining with rule-based classification method. Our result yields four percent of the accuracy improvement from simple classification applied only two lists of sentiment words. ;supervised learningRecommendation as link prediction in bipartite graphs: A graph kernel-based machine learning approach;X. Li & Chen;2013;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2012.09.019;Recommender systems have been widely adopted in online applications to suggest products, services, and contents to potential users. Collaborative filtering (CF) is a successful recommendation paradigm that employs transaction information to enrich user and item features for recommendation. By mapping transactions to a bipartite user–item interaction graph, a recommendation problem is converted into a link prediction problem, where the graph structure captures subtle information on relations between users and items. To take advantage of the structure of this graph, we propose a kernel-based recommendation approach and design a novel graph kernel that inspects customers and items (indirectly) related to the focal user–item pair as its context to predict whether there may be a link. In the graph kernel, we generate random walk paths starting from a focal user–item pair and define similarities between user–item pairs based on the random walk paths. We prove the validity of the kernel and apply it in a one-class classification framework for recommendation. We evaluate the proposed approach with three real-world datasets. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark algorithms, particularly when recommending a large number of items. The experiments show the necessity of capturing user–item graph structure in recommendation.;supervised learningCombining usage, content, and structure data to improve web site recommendation;J. Li & Za ıane;2004;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-30077-9_31;Web recommender systems anticipate the needs of web users and provide them with recommendations to personalize their navigation. Such systems had been expected to have a bright future, especially in e-commerce and e-learning environments. However, although they have been intensively explored in the Web Mining and Machine Learning fields, and there have been some commercialized systems, the quality of the recommendation and the user satisfaction of such systems are still not optimal. In this paper, we investigate a novel web recommender system, which combines usage data, content data, and structure data in a web site to generate user navigational models. These models are then fed back into the system to recommend users shortcuts or page resources. We also propose an evaluation mechanism to measure the quality of recommender systems. Preliminary experiments show that our system can significantly improve the quality of web site recommendation. ;unsupervised learningResearch of information recommendation system based on reading behavior;Q.-C. Li et al.;2008;https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620666;In modern knowledge explosion society, Humans’ ability to find the information they desire grows more slowly than the rate at which the new information becomes available. Recommendation system can reduce information overload and provide appropriate content to targeted user. This paper proposes a new recommending technique based on mining the user’s reading behavior, computing the user profile through 5W1H scheme. By comparing the user profile and the information representation, we can provide the customized content in suitable time to satisfy the user’s personalized requirement. For performance evaluation, we implement the technology to make experiments on real information and people. The results show that our technology and approach can acquire the user’s requirement, and recommend suitable information they really need.;supervised learningA multi-theoretical kernel-based approach to social network-based recommendation;X. Li et al.;2014;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2014.05.006;Recommender systems are a critical component of e-commerce websites. The rapid development of online social networking services provides an opportunity to explore social networks together with information used in traditional recommender systems, such as customer demographics, product characteristics, and transactions. It also provides more applications for recommender systems. To tackle this social network-based recommendation problem, previous studies generally built trust models in light of the social influence theory. This study inspects a spectrum of social network theories to systematically model the multiple facets of a social network and infer user preferences. In order to effectively make use of these heterogonous theories, we take a kernel-based machine learning paradigm, design and select kernels describing individual similarities according to social network theories, and employ a non-linear multiple kernel learning algorithm to combine the kernels into a unified model. This design also enables us to consider multiple theories' interactions in assessing individual behaviors. We evaluate our proposed approach on a real-world movie review data set. The experiments show that our approach provides more accurate recommendations than trust-based methods and the collaborative filtering approach. Further analysis shows that kernels derived from contagion theory and homophily theory contribute a larger portion of the model.;unsupervised learningDifference factor’ KNN collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm;Liang et al.;2014;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-14717-8_14;With the development of electronic commerce, Collaborative Filtering Recommendation system emerge, which uses machine learning algorithms for people provide a set of N items that will be of interest. In many user-based collaborative filtering applications based on KNN(K nearest neighbor algorithm), they only use similarity information(cosine similarity) between users, in some case, they have not use the difference information, so the precision and recall is not well. To address these problem, we propose a Difference Factor’ K-NN collaborative filtering method, called DF-KNN. DF-KNN is an instance- based learning method and the key step in algorithms is how to use the difference factor and how to compute, the second step is mix similarity together. Our experimental evaluation on the MovieLens datasets show that the proposed DF-KNN and NDF-KNN(Normal Different Factor’s KNN) are much efficient than the traditional user-neighborhood based KNN and provide recommendations whose quality is up to 13% better.;supervised learningLawyer information integration and recommendation by multi-source information validation;T. Liu et al.;2011;https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016956;On the internet, all-round lawyer information is located at separated information sources, which prevent web users from effective information acquisition. In order to build a unified view of separated, heterogeneous, and often redundant lawyer information, we propose a new information integration method using multi-source information cross-validation. Based on the unified integrated data, a lawyer recommendation system is built. Several key technologies are presented and evaluated, including the multi-source information acquisition and validation. Experimental results indicate the key techniques used in the system are effective for lawyer information integration and recommendation.;supervised learningCatlinks - A category clustering algorithm based on multi-class regression;R. Liu et al.;2014;https://doi.org/10.1109/CCIS.2014.7175752;This paper proposed CatLinks, a category clustering algorithm based on multi-class regression. In recommender systems for e-commerce web sites, users' experience of recommendations highly relies on the diversity of purchase suggestions. Taking inexpensive training data as products' literal information and their categories, CatLinks extracts latent features of categories and construct presentation of them as vectors. With vector presentation categories can be clustered by similarity measure and aggregation methods such as KNN or K-Means. Algorithm of CatLinks is based on training of a multi-class category predictor of products. After the predictor is trained, its weight matrix is taken as feature vectors of categories. With similarity of categories, recommender system can suggest users to purchase products from extended categories, when their interest on a certain category is discovered. Through our experiments on Alibaba's product and order dataset, CatLinks is proved a novel method to predict category co-occurrence of user's joint orders.;unsupervised learningCombining user-based and item-based models for collaborative filtering using stacked regression;Q. Liu et al.;2014;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-1747-7_17;Collaborative filtering can be classified into user-based or item-based methods according to different assumptions. Our experiment results show that both user-based and item-based methods can reach a certain degree of accuracy, but the recommendation coverage of these two methods is significantly different. This paper qualitatively analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of such two methods, and found that user-based methods advantage in recommending popular items while item-based methods perform better at suggesting long tail items. Based on this analysis, we proposes a novel machine learning framework to systematically combine both. We train a model for each user-item pair for discovering the local preference of the user or item over both methods, and effectively combine user-based and item-based predictions using the preference information. Experiment results show that our approach can significantly improve the recommendation quality, and to a certain extend, alleviate the data sparsity problem.;supervised learningA semantic content-based recommender system integrating folksonomies for personalized access;Lops et al.;2009;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-02794-9_2;Basic content personalization consists in matching up the attributes of a user profile, in which preferences and interests are stored, against the attributes of a content object. The Web 2.0 (r)evolution and the advent of user generated content (UGC) have changed the game for personalization, since the role of people has evolved from passive consumers of information to that of active contributors. One of the forms of UGC that has drawn more attention from the research community is folksonomy, a taxonomy generated by users who collaboratively annotate and categorize resources of interests with freely chosen keywords called tags.;supervised learningSecond order online collaborative filtering;J. Lu et al.;2013;https://proceedings.mlr.press/v29/Lu13.html;Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the most successful learning techniques in building real-world recommender systems. Traditional CF algorithms are often based on batch machine learning methods which suffer from several critical drawbacks, e.g., extremely ex- pensive model retraining cost whenever new samples arrive, unable to capture the latest change of user preferences over time, and high cost and slow reaction to new users or products extension. Such limitations make batch learning based CF methods unsuitable for real-world online applications where data often arrives sequentially and user preferences may change dynamically and rapidly. To address these limitations, we investigate online collaborative filtering techniques for building live recommender systems where the CF model can evolve on-the-y over time. Unlike the regular first order CF algorithms (e.g., online gradient descent for CF) that converge slowly, in this paper, we present a new framework of second order online collaborative filtering, i.e., Confidence Weighted On- line Collaborative Filtering (CWOCF), which applies the second order online optimization methodology to tackle the online collaborative giltering task. We conduct extensive experiments on several large-scale datasets, in which the encouraging results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms obtain significantly lower errors (both RMSE and MAE) than the state-of-the-art first order CF algorithms when receiving the same amount of training data in the online learning process.;supervised learningLeveraging semantic web technologies for more relevant e-tourism behavioral retargeting;C. Lu et al.;2015;https://doi.org/10.1145/2740908.2742001;The e-tourism is today an important field of the e-commerce. One specificity of this field is that consumers spend much time comparing many options on multiple websites before purchasing. It's easy for consumers to forget the viewed offers or websites. The Behavioral Retargeting (BR) is a widely used technique for online advertising. It leverages consumers' actions on advertisers' websites and displays relevant ads on publishers' websites. In this paper, we're interested in the relevance of the displayed ads in the e-tourism field. We present MERLOT 1, a Semantic-based travel destination recommender system that can be deployed to improve the relevance of BR in the e-tourism field. We conducted a preliminary experiment with the real data of a French travel agency. The results of 33 participants showed very promising results with regards to the baseline according to all used metrics. By this paper, we wish to provide a novel viewpoint to address the BR relevance problem, different from the dominating machine learning approaches. ;unsupervised learningExploiting social networks for publication venue recommendations;Luong, Huynh, Gauch, & Hoang;2012;https://doi.org/10.5220/0004140102390245;The impact of a publication venue is a major consideration for researchers and scholars when they are deciding where to publish their research results. By selecting the right conference or journal to which to submit a new paper minimizes the risk of wasting the long review time for a paper that is ultimately rejected. This task also helps to recommend appropriate conference venues of which authors may not be aware or to which colleagues often submit their papers. Traditional ways of scientific publication recommendation using content-based analysis have shown drawbacks due to mismatches caused by ambiguity in text comparisons and there is also much more to selecting an appropriate venue than just topical-matching. In our work, we are taking advantage of actual and interactive relationships within the academic community, as indicated by co-authorship, paper review or event co-organizing activities, to support the venue recommendation process. Specifically, we present a new social network-based approach that automatically finds appropriate publication venues for authors' research paper by exploring their network of related co-authors and other researchers in the same field. We also recommend appropriate publication venues to a specific user based on her relation with the program committee research activities and with others in her network who have similar paper submission preferences. This paper also presents more accurate and promising results of our social network-based in comparison with the baseline contentbased approach. Our experiment, which was empirically tested over a large set of scientific papers published in 16 different ACM conferences, showed that analysing an academic social network would be useful for a variety of recommendation tasks including trend of publications, expert findings, and research collaborations, etc.;unsupervised learningPublication venue recommendation using author network’s publication history;Luong, Huynh, Gauch, Do, & Hoang;2012;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-28493-9_45;Selecting a good conference or journal in which to publish a new article is very important to many researchers and scholars. The choice of publication venue is usually based on the author's existing knowledge of publication venues in their research domain or the match of the conference topics with their paper content. They may not be aware of new or other more appropriate conference venues to which their paper could be submitted. A traditional way to recommend a conference to a researcher is by analyzing her paper and comparing it to the topics of different conferences using content-based analysis. However, this approach can make errors due to mismatches caused by ambiguity in text comparisons. In this paper, we present a new approach allowing researchers to automatically find appropriate publication venues for their research paper by exploring author's network of related co-authors and other researchers in the same domain. This work is a part of our social network based recommendation research for research publications venues and interesting hot-topic researches. Experiments with a set of ACM SIG conferences show that our new approach outperforms the content-based approach and provides accurate recommendation. This works also demonstrates the feasibility of our ongoing approach aimed at using social network analysis of researchers and experts in the relevant research domains for a variety of recommendation tasks.;supervised learningAutomatic movie ratings prediction using machine learning;Marovi c et al.;2011;https://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/conf/mipro/MarovicMMPT11.html;Recommendation systems that model users and their interests are often used to improve various user services. Such systems are usually based on automatic prediction of user ratings of the items provided by the service. This paper presents an overview of some of the methods for automatic ratings prediction in the domain of movie ratings. The chosen methods are based on various approaches described in related papers. During the prediction process both the user and item features can be used. For the purpose of this paper, data was gathered from the publicly available movie database IMDb. The paper encompasses the implementation of the chosen methods and their evaluation using the gathered data. The results show an improvement in comparison to the chosen baseline methods.;unsupervised learningNew trends in musical genre classification using optimum-path forest;Marques et al.;2011;http://hdl.handle.net/11449/72943;Musical genre classification has been paramount in the last years, mainly in large multimedia datasets, in which new songs and genres can be added at every moment by anyone. In this context, we have seen the growing of musical recommendation systems, which can improve the benefits for several applications, such as social networks and collective musical libraries. In this work, we have introduced a recent machine learning technique named Optimum-Path Forest (OPF) for musical genre classification, which has been demonstrated to be similar to the state-of-the-art pattern recognition techniques, but much faster for some applications. Experiments in two public datasets were conducted against Support Vector Machines and a Bayesian classifier to show the validity of our work. In addition, we have executed an experiment using very recent hybrid feature selection techniques based on OPF to speed up feature extraction process.;supervised learningA collaborative filtering algorithm and evaluation metric that accurately model the user experience;McLaughlin & Herlocker;2004;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1008992.1009050;Collaborative Filtering (CF) systems have been researched for over a decade as a tool to deal with information overload. At the heart of these systems are the algorithms which generate the predictions and recommendations.In this article we empirically demonstrate that two of the most acclaimed CF recommendation algorithms have flaws that result in a dramatically unacceptable user experience.In response, we introduce a new Belief Distribution Algorithm that overcomes these flaws and provides substantially richer user modeling. The Belief Distribution Algorithm retains the qualities of nearest-neighbor algorithms which have performed well in the past, yet produces predictions of belief distributions across rating values rather than a point rating value.In addition, we illustrate how the exclusive use of the mean absolute error metric has concealed these flaws for so long, and we propose the use of a modified Precision metric for more accurately evaluating the user experience.;supervised learningOntological user profiling in recommender systems;Middleton et al.;2004;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/963770.963773;We explore a novel ontological approach to user profiling within recommender systems, working on the problem of recommending on-line academic research papers. Our two experimental systems, Quickstep and Foxtrot, create user profiles from unobtrusively monitored behaviour and relevance feedback, representing the profiles in terms of a research paper topic ontology. A novel profile visualization approach is taken to acquire profile feedback. Research papers are classified using ontological classes and collaborative recommendation algorithms used to recommend papers seen by similar people on their current topics of interest. Two small-scale experiments, with 24 subjects over 3 months, and a large-scale experiment, with 260 subjects over an academic year, are conducted to evaluate different aspects of our approach. Ontological inference is shown to improve user profiling, external ontological knowledge used to successfully bootstrap a recommender system and profile visualization employed to improve profiling accuracy. The overall performance of our ontological recommender systems are also presented and favourably compared to other systems in the literature.;unsupervised learningCollaborative tag recommendation system based on logistic regression;Monta˜n es et al.;2009;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228446030;This work proposes an approach to collaborative tag recom-mendation based on a machine learning system for probabilistic regres-sion. The goal of the method is to support users of current social network systems by providing a rank of new meaningful tags for a resource. This system provides a ranked tag set and it feeds on different posts depend-ing on the resource for which the recommendation is requested and on the user who requests the recommendation. Different kinds of collabora-tion among users and resources are introduced. That collaboration adds to the training set additional posts carefully selected according to the interaction among users and/or resources. Furthermore, a selection of post using scoring measures is also proposed including a penalization of oldest post. The performance of these approaches is tested according to F1 but just considering at most the first five tags of the ranking, which is the evaluation measure proposed in ECML PKDD Discovery Challenge 2009. The experiments were carried out over two different kind of data sets of Bibsonomy folksonomy, core and no core, reaching a performance of 26.25% for the former and 6.98% for the latter.;supervised learningTALMUD: Transfer learning for multiple domains;Moreno et al.;2012;https://doi.org/10.1145/2396761.2396817;Most collaborative Recommender Systems (RS) operate in a single domain (such as movies, books, etc.) and are capable of providing recommendations based on historical usage data which is collected in the specific domain only. Cross-domain recommenders address the sparsity problem by using Machine Learning (ML) techniques to transfer knowledge from a dense domain into a sparse target domain. In this paper we propose a transfer learning technique that extracts knowledge from multiple domains containing rich data (e.g., movies and music) and generates recommendations for a sparse target domain (e.g., games). Our method learns the relatedness between the different source domains and the target domain, without requiring overlapping users between domains. The model integrates the appropriate amount of knowledge from each domain in order to enrich the target domain data. Experiments with several datasets reveal that, using multiple sources and the relatedness between domains improves accuracy of results.;supervised learningA two-level learning hierarchy of concept based keyword extraction for tag recommendations;Murfi & Obermayer;2009;https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.364.221;Textual contents associated to resources are considered as sources of candidate tags to improve the performance of tag recommenders in social tagging systems. In this paper, we propose a twolevel learning hierarchy of a concept based keyword extraction method to filter the candidate tags and rank them based on their occurrences in concepts existing in the given resources. Incorporating user-created tags to extract the hidden concept-document relationships distinguishes the two-level from the one-level learning version, which extracts concepts directly using terms existing in textual contents. Our experiment shows that a multi-concept approach, which considers more than one concept for each resource, improves the performance of a single-concept approach, which takes into account just the most relevant concept. Moreover, the experiments also prove that the proposed two-level learning hierarchy gives better performances than one of the one-level version.;supervised learningIntegrating a content-based recommender system into digital libraries for cultural heritage;Musto et al.;2010;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007%2F978-3-642-15850-6_4;Throughout the last decade, the area of Digital Libraries (DL) get more and more interest from both the research and development communities. Likewise, since the release of new platforms enriches them with new features and makes DL more powerful and effective, the number of web sites integrating these kind of tools is rapidly growing. In this paper we propose an approach for the exploitation of digital libraries for personalization goal in cultural heritage scenario. Specifically, we tried to integrate FIRSt (Folksonomy-based Item Recommender syStem), a content-based recommender system developed at the University of Bari, and Fedora, a flexible digital library architecture, in a framework for the adaptive fruition of cultural heritage implemented within the activities of the CHAT research project. In this scenario, the role of the digital library was to store information (such as textual and multimedial ones) about paintings gathered from the Vatican Picture Gallery and to provide them in a multimodal and personalized way through a PDA device given to a user before her visit in a museum. This paper describes the system architecture of our recommender system and its integration in the framework implemented for the CHAT project, showing how this recommendation model has been applied to recommend the artworks located at the Vatican Picture Gallery (Pinacoteca Vaticana), providing users with a personalized museum tour tailored on their tastes. The experimental evaluation we performed also confirmed that these recommendation services are really able to catch the real user preferences thus improving their experience in cultural heritage fruition.;supervised learningRedTweet: recommendation engine for reddit;Nguyen et al.;2016;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10844-016-0410-y;Twitter and Reddit are two of the most popular social media sites used today. In this paper, we study the use of machine learning and WordNet-based classifiers to generate an interest profile from a user’s tweets and use this to recommend loosely related Reddit threads which the reader is most likely to be interested in. We introduce a genre classification algorithm using a similarity measure derived from WordNet lexical database for English to label genres for nouns in tweets. The proposed algorithm generates a user’s interest profile from their tweets based on a referencing taxonomy of genres derived from the genre-tagged Brown Corpus augmented with a technology genre. The top K genres of a user’s interest profile can be used for recommending subreddit articles in those genres. Experiments using real life test cases collected from Twitter have been done to compare the performance on genre classification by using the WordNet classifier and machine learning classifiers such as SVM, Random Forests, and an ensemble of Bayesian classifiers. Empirically, we have obtained similar results from the two different approaches with a sufficient number of tweets. It seems that machine learning algorithms as well as the WordNet ontology are viable tools for developing recommendation engine based on genre classification. One advantage of the WordNet approach is simplicity and no learning is required. However, the WordNet classifier tends to have poor precision on users with very few tweets.;unsupervised learningImproving offline evaluation of contextual bandit algorithms via bootstrapping techniques;Nicol et al.;2014;https://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/mary14.html;In many recommendation applications such as news recommendation, the items that can be recommended come and go at a very fast pace. This is a challenge for recommender systems (RS) to face this setting. Online learning algorithms seem to be the most straight forward solution. The contextual bandit framework was introduced for that very purpose. In general the evaluation of a RS is a critical issue. Live evaluation is often avoided due to the potential loss of revenue, hence the need for offline evaluation methods. Two options are available. Model based methods are biased by nature and are thus difficult to trust when used alone. Data driven methods are therefore what we consider here. Evaluating online learning algorithms with past data is not simple but some methods exist in the literature. Nonetheless their accuracy is not satisfactory mainly due to their mechanism of data rejection that only allow the exploitation of a small fraction of the data. We precisely address this issue in this paper. After highlighting the limitations of the previous methods, we present a new method, based on bootstrapping techniques. This new method comes with two important improvements: it is much more accurate and it provides a measure of quality of its estimation. The latter is a highly desirable property in order to minimize the risks entailed by putting online a RS for the first time. We provide both theoretical and experimental proofs of its superiority compared to state-of-the-art methods, as well as an analysis of the convergence of the measure of quality.;supervised learningJoint Schatten lp-norm robust matrix completion for missing value recovery;Nie et al.;2013;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10115-013-0713-z;The low-rank matrix completion problem is a fundamental machine learning and data mining problem with many important applications. The standard low-rank matrix completion methods relax the rank minimization problem by the trace norm minimization. However, this relaxation may make the solution seriously deviate from the original solution. Meanwhile, most completion methods minimize the squared prediction errors on the observed entries, which is sensitive to outliers. In this paper, we propose a new robust matrix completion method to address these two problems. The joint Schatten $$p$$ p -norm and $$\ell _p$$ ℓ p -norm are used to better approximate the rank minimization problem and enhance the robustness to outliers. The extensive experiments are performed on both synthetic data and real-world applications in collaborative filtering prediction and social network link recovery. All empirical results show that our new method outperforms the standard matrix completion methods;supervised learningThe task of guiding in adaptive recommender systems;Hern andez del Olmo et al.;2009;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.eswa.2007.12.070;In this paper, we study the recommendation problem as formed by two tasks: (i) to filter useful/interesting items, (ii) to guide the user to good recommendations. The first task has been widely studied in the field of recommender systems. In fact, the most common characterization of these systems is based on the algorithms that select (filter) the items to be recommended (e.g. collaborative filtering, content-based, etc.). Through this paper, we will focus on the second task: the task of guiding the user. We claim that this task needs a closer attention. In this paper, we report an experiment to provide evidence for this fact. Actually, the experiment shows that machine learning algorithms commonly applied to the first task become useless when applied to the task of guiding.;supervised learningLink prediction across time via cross-temporal locality preserving projections;Oyama et al.;2012;https://ci.nii.ac.jp/lognavi?name=crossref&id=info:doi/10.1587/transinf.E95.D.2664;"Link prediction is the task of inferring the existence or absence of certain relationships among data objects such as identity, interaction, and collaboration. Link prediction is found in various applications in the fields of information integration, recommender systems, bioinformatics, and social network analysis. The increasing interest in dynamically changing networks has led to growing interest in a more general link prediction problem called <i>temporal link prediction</i> in the data mining and machine learning communities. However, only links among nodes at the same time point are considered in temporal link prediction. We propose a new link prediction problem called <i>cross-temporal link prediction</i> in which the links among nodes at different time points are inferred. A typical example of cross-temporal link prediction is cross-temporal entity resolution to determine the identity of real entities represented by data objects observed in different time periods. In dynamic environments, the features of data change over time, making it difficult to identify cross-temporal links by directly comparing observed data. Other examples of cross-temporal links are asynchronous communications in social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, where a message is posted in reply to a previous message. We adopt a dimension reduction approach to cross-temporal link prediction; that is, data objects in different time frames are mapped into a common low-dimensional latent feature space, and the links are identified on the basis of the distance between the data objects. The proposed method uses different low-dimensional feature projections in different time frames, enabling it to adapt to changes in the latent features over time. Using multi-task learning, it jointly learns a set of feature projection matrices from the training data, given the assumption of temporal smoothness of the projections. The optimal solutions are obtained by solving a single generalized eigenvalue problem. Experiments using a real-world set of bibliographic data for cross-temporal entity resolution and a real-world set of emails for unobserved asynchronous communication inference showed that introducing time-dependent feature projections improved the accuracy of link prediction.";supervised learningAutomatic image tagging and recommendation via PARAFAC2;Pantraki & Kotropoulos;2015;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324363;An important aspect when sharing images in social networks is the tags the images are annotated with. Another closely related problem is the ability to successfully recommend images to users. An automatic image annotation and recommendation system is proposed based on Parallel Factor Analysis 2 (PARAFAC2). Here, PARAFAC2 is applied to a collection of three matrices, namely the image-feature matrix, whose columns are representations capturing the visual appearance of images, the image-tag matrix, whose columns indicate the tags associated with each image, and the image-user matrix, whose columns identify who has uploaded or is associated to each image. PARAFAC2 is able to harness the multi-tag and the multi-user information for reducing the dimensionality of the feature vectors extracted from the images. That is, by projecting the feature vector onto the semantic space derived via PARAFAC2, a sketch (i.e., a coefficient vector of reduced dimensions) is obtained. To predict the tags to be assigned to a test image, the test image sketch is multiplied by the left singular vectors of the image-tag matrix, yielding a tag vector. Similarly, to recommend users who might be interested to a test image, the sketch is multiplied by the left singular vectors of the image-user matrix, yielding a recommendation vector. Promising results are demonstrated when the aforementioned framework is applied to an image dataset of Greek popular tourist landmarks extracted from Flickr, using a 10 fold cross-validation experimental protocol.;supervised learningMachine learned job recommendation;Paparrizos et al.;2011;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2043932.2043994;We address the problem of recommending suitable jobs to people who are seeking a new job. We formulate this recommendation problem as a supervised machine learning problem. Our technique exploits all past job transitions as well as the data associated with employees and institutions to predict an employee's next job transition. We train a machine learning model using a large number of job transitions extracted from the publicly available employee profiles in the Web. Experiments show that job transitions can be accurately predicted, significantly improving over a baseline that always predicts the most frequent institution in the data.;supervised learningDimensionality reduction for supervised learning in link prediction problems;Pecli et al.;2015;https://doi.org/10.5220/0005371802950302;In recent years, a considerable amount of attention has been devoted to research on complex networks and their properties. Collaborative environments, social networks and recommender systems are popular examples of complex networks that emerged recently and are object of interest in academy and industry. Many studies model complex networks as graphs and tackle the link prediction problem, one major open question in network evolution. It consists in predicting the likelihood of an association between two not interconnected nodes in a graph to appear. One of the approaches to such problem is based on binary classification supervised learning. Although the curse of dimensionality is a historical obstacle in machine learning, little effort has been applied to deal with it in the link prediction scenario. So, this paper evaluates the effects of dimensionality reduction as a preprocessing stage to the binary classifier construction in link prediction applications. Two dimensionality reduction strategies are experimented: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Forward Feature Selection (FFS). The results of experiments with three different datasets and four traditional machine learning algorithms show that dimensionality reduction with PCA and FFS can improve model precision in this kind of problem.;supervised learningLearning to rank for collaborative filtering;Pessiot et al.;2007;https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01336029/;Up to now, most contributions to collaborative filtering rely on rating prediction to generate the recommendations. We, instead, try to correctly rank the items according to the users’ tastes. First, we define a ranking error function which takes available pairwise preferences between items into account. Then we design an effective algorithm that optimizes this error. Finally we illustrate the proposal on a standard collaborative filtering dataset. We adapted the evaluation protocol proposed by (Marlin, 2004) for rating prediction based systems to our case, where pairwise preferences are predicted instead. The preliminary results are between those of two reference rating prediction based methods. We suggest different directions to further explore our ranking based approach for collaborative filtering.;supervised learningAspect-based restaurant information extraction for the recommendation system;Pronoza et al.;2016;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-43808-5_28;In this paper information extraction task for the restaurant recommendation system is considered. We develop an information extraction system which is intended to gather restaurants aspects from users’ reviews and output them to the recommendation module. As many of the restaurant aspects are subjective, our task can also be called sentiment analysis, or opinion mining. Thus, we present an aspect-based approach towards sentiment analysis of reviews about restaurants for e-tourism recommender systems. The analyzed frames are service and food quality, cuisine, price level, noise level, etc. In this paper we focus on service quality, cuisine type and food quality. As part of the preprocessing phase, a method for Russian reviews corpus analysis (as part of information extraction) is proposed. Its importance is shown at the experimental phase, when the application of machine learning techniques to aspects extraction is analyzed. It is shown that the information obtained during corpus analysis improve system performance. We conduct experiments with several feature sets and classifiers and show that the use of resources learnt from the corpus leads to the improvement of the models. Naïve Bayes appears to be the best choice for sentiment classification, while Logistic Regression and SVM are best at deciding on the relevance of a review with respect to the particular aspect.;supervised learningThe collaborative filtering recommendation based on SOM cluster-indexing CBR;Roh et al.;2003;https://doi.org/10.1016/S0957-4174(03)00067-8;Collaborative filtering (CF) recommendation is a knowledge sharing technology for distribution of opinions and facilitating contacts in network society between people with similar interests. The main concerns of the CF algorithm are about prediction accuracy, speed of response time, problem of data sparsity, and scalability. In general, the efforts of improving prediction algorithms and lessening response time are decoupled. We propose a three-step CF recommendation model, which is composed of profiling, inferring, and predicting steps while considering prediction accuracy and computing speed simultaneously. This model combines a CF algorithm with two machine learning processes, Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Case Based Reasoning (CBR) by changing an unsupervized clustering problem into a supervized user preference reasoning problem, which is a novel approach for the CF recommendation field. This paper demonstrates the utility of the CF recommendation based on SOM cluster-indexing CBR with validation against control algorithms through an open dataset of user preference.;supervised learningA health social network recommender system;I. Song et al.;2011;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25044-6_29;People with chronic health conditions require support beyond normal health care systems. Social networking has shown great potential to provide the needed support. Because of the privacy and security issues of health information systems, it is often difficult to find patients who can support each other in the community. We propose a social-networking framework for patient care, in particular for parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). In the framework, health service providers facilitate social links between parents using similarities of assessment reports without revealing sensitive information. A machine learning approach was developed to generate explanations of ASD assessments in order to assist clinicians in their assessment. The generated explanations are then used to measure similarities between assessments in order to recommend a community of related parents. For the first time, we report on the accuracy of social linking using an explanation-based similarity measure.;supervised learningAutomatic tag recommendation algorithms for social recommender systems;Y. Song et al.;2011;https://doi.org/10.1145/1921591.1921595;The emergence of Web 2.0 and the consequent success of social network Web sites such as Del.icio.us and Flickr introduce us to a new concept called social bookmarking, or tagging. Tagging is the action of connecting a relevant user-defined keyword to a document, image, or video, which helps the user to better organize and share their collections of interesting stuff. With the rapid growth of Web 2.0, tagged data is becoming more and more abundant on the social network Web sites. An interesting problem is how to automate the process of making tag recommendations to users when a new resource becomes available. In this article, we address the issue of tag recommendation from a machine learning perspective. From our empirical observation of two large-scale datasets, we first argue that the user-centered approach for tag recommendation is not very effective in practice. Consequently, we propose two novel document-centered approaches that are capable ofmaking effective and efficient tag recommendations in real scenarios. The first, graph-based, method represents the tagged data in two bipartite graphs, (document, tag) and (document, word), then finds document topics by leveraging graph partitioning algorithms. The second, prototypebased, method aims at finding the most representative documents within the data collections and advocates a sparse multiclass Gaussian process classifier for efficient document classification. For both methods, tags are ranked within each topic cluster/class by a novel ranking method. Recommendations are performed by first classifying a new document into one or more topic clusters/classes, and then selecting the most relevant tags from those clusters/classes as machine-recommended tags. Experiments on real-world data from Del.icio.us, CiteULike, and BibSonomy examine the quality of tag recommendation as well as the efficiency of our recommendation algorithms. The results suggest that our document-centered models can substantially improve the performance of tag recommendations when compared to the user-centered methods, as well as topic models LDA and SVM classifiers.;unsupervised learningRoad-based travel recommendation using geo-tagged images;Sun et al.;2015;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2013.07.006;Geotagged photos on social media like Flickr explicitly indicate the trajectories of tourists. They can be employed to reveal the tourists’ preference on landmarks and routings of tourism. Most of existing works on routing searches are based on the trajectories of GPS-enabled devices’ users. From a distinct point of view, we attempt to propose a novel approach in which the basic unit of routing is separate road segment instead of GPS trajectory segment. In this paper, we build a recommendation system that provides users with the most popular landmarks as well as the best travel routings between the landmarks. By using Flickr geotaggged photos, the top ranking travel destinations in a city can be identified and then the best travel routes between the popular travel destinations are recommended. We apply a spatial clustering method to identify the main travel landmarks and subsequently rank these landmarks. Using machine learning method, we calculate the tourism popularity of the road in terms of relevant parameters, e.g., the number of users and the number of Point-of-Interests. These popularity assessments are integrated into the routing recommendation system. The routing recommendation system takes into consideration both the popularity assessment and the length of the road. The best route recommended to the user minimizes the distance while including maximal tourism popularity. Experiments were conducted in two different scenarios. The empirical results show that the recommendation system is able to provide the user good travel planning including both top ranking landmarks and suitable routings in a city. Besides, the system offers user-generated semantic information for the recommended routes.;supervised learningCollaborative filtering via group-structured dictionary learning;Szab o et al.;2012;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-28551-6_31;Structured sparse coding and the related structured dictionary learning problems are novel research areas in machine learning. In this paper we present a new application of structured dictionary learning for collaborative filtering based recommender systems. Our extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the presented method outperforms its state-of-the-art competitors and has several advantages over approaches that do not put structured constraints on the dictionary elements.;supervised learningIdentification of category associations using a multilabel classifier;Szyma nski & Rzeniewicz;2016;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2016.05.039;Description of the data using categories allows one to describe it on a higher abstraction level. In this way, we can operate on aggregated groups of the information, allowing one to see relationships that do not appear explicit when we analyze the individual objects separately. In this paper we present automatic identification of the associations between categories used for organization of the textual data. As experimental data we used a network of English Wikipedia articles and their associated categories, that have been preprocessed by a dedicated filtering method for noise reduction. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of the method based on supervised machine learning for mining relations between these categories. We describe existing in the literature category proximity metrics as well as introduce three new ones, based on observing the properties of a multilabel Support Vector Machine classifier. The first metric uses classifier predictions, the second uses its errors, and the third is based on its model. Comparison to the existing state-of-the-art methods, and to manual assessments, confirm that the proposed methods are useful and are more flexible than typical approaches. We show how different metrics allow us to introduce new significant relations between categories. Aggregated results of mining categories’ associations have been used to build a semantic network that shows a practical application of the research. The proposed method for finding associations can be extended with using other approaches than SVM classification, and can find (other than presented in the paper) applications for mining categories in text repositories. Eg.: it can be used for extending the prediction of the rating in recommender systems or as a method of missing data imputation.;supervised learningMatrix factorization and neighbor based algorithms for the netflix prize problem;Tak acs et al.;2008;https://doi.org/10.1145/1454008.1454049;Collaborative filtering (CF) approaches proved to be effective for recommender systems in predicting user preferences in item selection using known user ratings of items. This subfield of machine learning has gained a lot of popularity with the Netflix Prize competition started in October 2006. Two major approaches for this problem are matrix factorization (MF) and the neighbor based approach (NB). In this work, we propose various variants of MF and NB that can boost the performance of the usual ensemble based scheme. First, we investigate various regularization scenarios for MF. Second, we introduce two NB methods: one is based on correlation coefficients and the other on linear least squares. At the experimentation part, we show that the proposed approaches compare favorably with existing ones in terms of prediction accuracy and/or required training time. We present results of blending the proposed methods.;supervised learningScalable collaborative filtering approaches for large reeommender systems;Tak aes et al.;2009;https://doi.org/10.1145/1577069.1577091;The collaborative filtering (CF) using known user ratings of items has proved to be effective for predicting user preferences in item selection. This thriving subfield of machine learning became popular in the late 1990s with the spread of online services that use recommender systems, such as Amazon, Yahoo! Music, and Netflix. CF approaches are usually designed to work on very large data sets. Therefore the scalability of the methods is crucial. In this work, we propose various scalable solutions that are validated against the Netflix Prize data set, currently the largest publicly available collection. First, we propose various matrix factorization (MF) based techniques. Second, a neighbor correction method for MF is outlined, which alloys the global perspective of MF and the localized property of neighbor based approaches efficiently. In the experimentation section, we first report on some implementation issues, and we suggest on how parameter optimization can be performed efficiently for MFs. We then show that the proposed scalable approaches compare favorably with existing ones in terms of prediction accuracy and/or required training time. Finally, we report on some experiments performed on MovieLens and Jester data sets.;supervised learningOn the design of social voting recommendation applications;Tsapatsoulis et al.;2015;https://doi.org/10.1142/s0218213015500098;"Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) are online tools that match the policy preferences of voters with the policy positions of political parties or candidates. Designed to enhance the political competence of citizens, VAAs have become increasingly popular and institutionally embedded in a growing number of European countries. While the traditional VAA relied on the stated position or academically coded position of parties/candidates, a recent innovation has been to introduce a social vote recommendation borrowing the basic principles of collaborative filtering. The latter takes advantage of the community of VAA users to provide a vote recommendation. This paper provides an overview of the social vote recommendation scheme and tackles three problems related to its optimal implementation in a real–world setting: (1) the number of samples required to train party models; (2) whether this number is affected by differences in characteristics between early users versus late users; and (3) whether generalizations can be derived across VAA applications in different countries. For our experiments we use three real VAA datasets based on elections in Greece 2012, Cyprus 2013 and Germany 2013. The corresponding datasets are made freely available to other researchers working in the areas of VAA and web based recommender systems.";supervised learningBook recommendation using machine learning methods based on library loan records and bibliographic information;Tsuji et al.;2014;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2014.26;We propose a method to recommend books through machine learning modules based on several features, including library loan records. We evaluated the most effective method among ones using (a) a Support Vector Machine (SVM), (b) Random Forest and (c) Adaboost, as well as the most effective combination of relevant features among (1) library loan records, (2) book titles, (3) Nippon Decimal Classification categories, (4) publication year and (5) frequencies at which books were borrowed. We performed an experiment involving 40 subjects who are students at T University. The books that our methods recommended and the loan records that we used were obtained from the T University Library. The results show that books recommended by the SVM based on features (1), (2), (3) and (5) were rated most favorably by the subjects. Our method outperforms preceding ones, such as the method proposed by Tsuji et al. (2013), and is comparable in performance to the recommendation by the website Amazon.co.jp.;supervised learningImproving Scalability of Personalized Recommendation Systems for Enterprise Knowledge Workers;Verma et al.;2016;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2513000;Enterprise knowledge workers have been overwhelmed by the growing rate of incoming data in recent years. In this paper, we present a recommendation system with the goal of helping knowledge workers in discovering useful new content. In particular, our system builds personalized user models based on file activities on enterprise network file servers. Our models use novel features that are derived from file metadata and user collaboration. Through extensive evaluation on real-world enterprise data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our system with high precision and recall values. Unfortunately, our experiments reveal that per-user models are unable to handle heavy workloads. To address this limitation, we propose a novel optimization technique, active feature-based model selection, that predicts the user models that should be applied on each test file. Such a technique can reduce the classification time per file by as much as 23 times without sacrificing accuracy. We also show how this technique can be extended to improve the scalability exponentially at marginal cost of prediction accuracy, e.g., we can gain 169 times faster performance on an average across all shares by sacrificing 4% of F-score.;supervised learningA data mining approach to guide students through the enrollment process based on academic performance;Vialardi et al.;2011;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11257-011-9098-4;Student academic performance at universities is crucial for education management systems. Many actions and decisions are made based on it, specifically the enrollment process. During enrollment, students have to decide which courses to sign up for. This research presents the rationale behind the design of a recommender system to support the enrollment process using the students’ academic performance record. To build this system, the CRISP-DM methodology was applied to data from students of the Computer Science Department at University of Lima, Perú. One of the main contributions of this work is the use of two synthetic attributes to improve the relevance of the recommendations made. The first attribute estimates the inherent difficulty of a given course. The second attribute, named potential, is a measure of the competence of a student for a given course based on the grades obtained in related courses. Data was mined using C4.5, KNN (K-nearest neighbor), Naïve Bayes, Bagging and Boosting, and a set of experiments was developed in order to determine the best algorithm for this application domain. Results indicate that Bagging is the best method regarding predictive accuracy. Based on these results, the “Student Performance Recommender System” (SPRS) was developed, including a learning engine. SPRS was tested with a sample group of 39 students during the enrollment process. Results showed that the system had a very good performance under real-life conditions.;supervised learningDiscovering social network to improve recommender system for group learning support;Wan et al.;2009;https://doi.org/10.1109/CISE.2009.5363890;We refer to a new generation of Web technologies such as social networking to address a recommender system that emphasize online collaborative learning. We propose an approach for improving recommender system through exploiting the learners note taking activity. We maintain that notes' features can be exploited by collaborative learning systems in order to enrich and extend the user profile and improve personalized learning. Thus our approach stresses collaborative note as a new and powerful kind of feedback and as a way to infer learner profiles. The experiment results show that our approach is effective.;supervised learningLearning to recommend based on slope one strategy;Wang et al.;2012;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-29253-8_47;Recommendation systems provide us a promising approach to deal with the information overload problem. Collaborative filtering is the key technology in these systems. In the past decades, model-based and memory-based methods have been the main research areas of collaborative filtering. Empirically, model-based methods may achieve higher prediction accuracy than memory-based methods. On the other side, memory-based methods (e.g. slope one algorithm) provide a concise and intuitive justification for the computed predictions. In order to take advantages of both model-based and memory-based methods, we propose a new approach by introducing the idea of machine learning to slope one algorithm. Several strategies are presented in this paper to catch this goal. Experiments on the MovieLens dataset show that our approach achieves great improvement of prediction accuracy.;supervised learningEstimating trust strength for supporting effective recommendation services;Wei et al.;2011;https://aisel.aisnet.org/pacis2011/212;In the age of information explosion, Internet facilitates product searching and collecting much more convenient for users. However, it is time-consuming and exhausting for users to deal with large amounts of product information. In response, various recommendation approaches have been developed to recommend products that match users’ preferences and requirements. In addition to the well-known collaborative filtering recommendation approach, the trust-based recommendation approach is the emerging one. The reason is that most of online communities allow users to express their trust on other users. Based on the analysis of trust relationships, the trust-based recommendation approach finds out and consults the opinions of more reliable users and therefore makes better recommendations. Existing trust-based recommendation techniques consider all trust relationships in a given trust network equally important and give them the same trust strength. However, in a real-world setting, trust relationships may be of various strengths. In response, in this study, we propose a mechanism for trust strength estimation on the basis of the machine learning approach and estimate the trust strength for each existing trust relationship in a given trust network. To overcome the sparsity of the trust network, we also develop a modified trust propagation method to expand the original trust network. Finally, we perform a series of experiments to demonstrate the performance of our trust-based recommendation approach based on the trust strength estimation mechanism. Our empirical evaluation results show that our proposed approach outperforms our benchmark techniques, i.e., the traditional collaborative filtering approach and the original trust-based one.;supervised learningConstructing topic models of internet of things for information processing;Xin et al.;2014;https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/675234;Internet of Things (IoT) is regarded as a remarkable development of the modern information technology. There is abundant digital products data on the IoT, linking with multiple types of objects/entities. Those associated entities carry rich information and usually in the form of query records. Therefore, constructing high quality topic hierarchies that can capture the term distribution of each product record enables us to better understand users’ search intent and benefits tasks such as taxonomy construction, recommendation systems, and other communications solutions for the future IoT. In this paper, we propose a novel record entity topic model (RETM) for IoT environment that is associated with a set of entities and records and a Gibbs sampling-based algorithm is proposed to learn the model. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets and compare our approach with existing methods to demonstrate the advantage of our approach.;supervised learningExtension of similarity measures in VSM: From orthogonal coordinate system to affine coordinate system;Xuan et al.;2014;https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2014.6889693;Similarity measures are the foundations of many research areas, e.g. information retrieval, recommender system and machine learning algorithms. Promoted by these application scenarios, a number of similarity measures have been proposed and proposing. In these state-of-the-art measures, vector-based representation is widely accepted based on Vector Space Model (VSM) in which an object is represented as a vector composed of its features. Then, the similarity between two objects is evaluated by the operations on two corresponding vectors, like cosine, extended jaccard, extended dice and so on. However, there is an assumption that the features are independent of each others. This assumption is apparently unrealistic, and normally, there are relations between features, i.e. the co-occurrence relations between keywords in text mining area. In this paper, a space geometry-based method is proposed to extend the VSM from the orthogonal coordinate system (OVSM) to affine coordinate system (AVSM) and OVSM is proved to be a special case of AVSM. Unit coordinate vectors of AVSM are inferred by the relations between features which are considered as angles between these unit coordinate vectors. At last, five different similarity measures are extended from OVSM to AVSM using unit coordinate vectors of AVSM. Within the numerous application fields of similarity measures, the task of text clustering is selected to be the evaluation criterion. Documents are represented as vectors in OVSM and AVSM, respectively. The clustering results show that AVSM outweighs the OVSM.;unsupervised learningEnhancing trustworthiness evaluation in internetware with similarity and non-negative constraints;Yan et al.;2013;https://doi.org/10.1145/2532443.2532459;Internetware is envisioned as a new software paradigm where software developers usually need to interact with unknown partners as well as the software entities developed by them. To reduce uncertainty and boost collaborations in such setting, it is important to provide trustworthiness evaluation mechanisms so that trustworthy partners/entities can be easily found. In this work, we propose a novel trustworthiness evaluation mechanism by enhancing existing mechanisms with similarity and non-negative constraints. To be specific, we first extend an existing multi-aspect trust inference model by incorporating the non-negative constraint. One of the advantages of such constraint is its strong interpretability. Second, we incorporate similarity into two neighborhood models borrowed from recommender systems. When computing similarity, we make use of the intermediate results from the first step. Finally, these models are combined under a machine learning framework. To show the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on a real data-set. The results show that: both our non-negativity extension and similarity computation improve the evaluation accuracy of the original methods, and the combined method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.;supervised learningDynamically-optimized context in recommender systems;Yap et al.;2005;https://doi.org/10.1145/1071246.1071289;Traditional approaches to recommender systems have not taken into account situational information when making recommendations, and this seriously limits the relevance of the results. This paper advocates context-awareness as a promising approach to enhance the performance of recommenders, and introduces a mechanism to realize this approach. We present a framework that separates the contextual concerns from the actual recommendation module, so that contexts can be readily shared across applications. More importantly, we devise a learning algorithm to dynamically identify the optimal set of contexts for a specific recommendation task and user. An extensive series of experiments has validated that our system is indeed able to learn both quickly and accurately.;supervised learningRecommendation based on latent topics and social network analysis;Yeh & Wu;2010;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICCEA.2010.48;In 2007, Netflex provided a large training dataset describing user ratings of movies for KDD Cup contest. Many competitors proposed various kinds of data mining model trying to achieve the best prediction performance. The first place winner among the competitors got the best root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.256. Most of the models applied statistical machines learning techniques with collaborative mining approach to achieve their best performance. In this paper, a hybrid recommendation model is proposed to get better prediction result which combines both content-based and collaborative recommendation approaches with latent topic discovery and social network analysis. This model was tested using 2007 KDD Cup movie dataset and found that either with single content-based approach or single collaborative approach is hard to get better RMSE result than hybrid models. By combining both kinds of approaches, the latent-topic-only approach observed in our experiment achieves only RMSE=0.274, while with Bonacich power centrality in social network get better improvement to 0.252, which proved that our model is better than all of the competitors in the contest.;supervised learningExploiting sentiment homophily for link prediction;Yuan et al.;2014;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2645710.2645734;"Link prediction on social media is an important problem for recommendation systems. Understanding the interplay of users' sentiments and social relationships can be potentially valuable. Specifically, we study how to exploit sentiment homophily for link prediction. We evaluate our approach on a dataset gathered from Twitter that consists of tweets sent in one month during U.S. 2012 political campaign along with the "" follows "" relationship between users. Our first contribution is defining a set of sentiment-based features that help predict the likelihood of two users becoming "" friends "" (i.e., mutually mentioning or following each other) based on their sentiments toward topics of mutual interest. Our evaluation in a supervised learning framework demonstrates the benefits of sentiment-based features in link prediction. We find that Adamic-Adar and Euclidean distance measures are the best predictors. Our second contribution is proposing a factor graph model that incorporates a sentiment-based variant of cognitive balance theory. Our evaluation shows that, when tie strength is not too weak, our model is more effective in link prediction than traditional machine learning techniques.";supervised learningNovel centroid selection approaches for KMeans-clustering based recommender systems;Zahra et al.;2015;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2015.03.062;Recommender systems have the ability to filter unseen information for predicting whether a particular user would prefer a given item when making a choice. Over the years, this process has been dependent on robust applications of data mining and machine learning techniques, which are known to have scalability issues when being applied for recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a k-means clustering-based recommendation algorithm, which addresses the scalability issues associated with traditional recommender systems. An issue with traditional k-means clustering algorithms is that they choose the initial k centroid randomly, which leads to inaccurate recommendations and increased cost for offline training of clusters. The work in this paper highlights how centroid selection in k-means based recommender systems can improve performance as well as being cost saving. The proposed centroid selection method has the ability to exploit underlying data correlation structures, which has been proven to exhibit superior accuracy and performance in comparison to the traditional centroid selection strategies, which choose centroids randomly. The proposed approach has been validated with an extensive set of experiments based on five different datasets (from movies, books, and music domain). These experiments prove that the proposed approach provides a better quality cluster and converges quicker than existing approaches, which in turn improves accuracy of the recommendation provided.;unsupervised learningRefine social relations and differentiate the same friends’ influence in recommender system;Zhai & Li;2015;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-26832-3_47;Social relations has been widely used in recommender system to improve accuracy of recommendations. Most works consider influence from overall friends simultaneously when recommending, and to each item the same friend always has equal influence. However, existing models fail to be consistent with real life recommendations, because in real life only a part of friends can affect our decisions, and we couldn’t be influenced by the same friends on everything. So in this paper, we use machine learning way to infer truly influential friends in a mixed friends circle. And to different items we use relevance to differentiate the same friend’s influence. A model, Topic-based Friends Refining Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (TFR-PMF), is proposed to check the performance of our theory. Through experiments on public data set, we domenstrate that our method can increase the accuracy of recommendation by 6.5 %, comparing with models that do not filter unrelated friends’ influence.;supervised learningBuilding personalized recommendation system in E-Commerce using association rule-based mining and classification;X.-Z. Zhang;2007;https://doi.org/10.1109/icmlc.2007.4370866;Due to the convenience of Internet, people can search for whatever information they need and buy whatever they want on the web. In the age of E- Commerce, it is difficult to provide support for customers to find the most valuable products that match their heterogeneous needs. Traditional approaches to this so-called personalization problem adopt pre-defined formats to describe the customer requirements. This always leads to distortion in eliciting requirement information and thus inaccurate recommendations. In this paper,we propose a personalized recommendation system using association rule mining and classification in e-commerce. Customer requirements are extracted from text documents and transformed into a set of significant phrases. Allowing the transformed transaction records, a set of association rule are mined from database using Apriori algorithm. CBA-CB algorithm is applied to produce the best rules out of the whole set of rules. The best classifiers are then generated after the test and validation of those rules, aimed to predict the item labels for new customer requirements and thus assigns the corresponding class labels to the customer. The system analysis and design of the proposed recommendation system as well as the implementation of prototype are also presented.;supervised learningHelpful or Unhelpful: A Linear Approach for Ranking Product Reviews;R. Zhang & Tran;2010;https://www.proquest.com/openview/7168cab39c20cd546c082ac17634af60/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=44515;"Most E-commerce web sites and online communities provide interfaces and platforms for consumers to express their opinions about a specific product by writing personal reviews. The fast development of E-commerce has caused such a huge amount of online product reviews to become available to consumers that it is impossible for potential consumers to read through all the reviews and to make a quick purchasing decision. Review readers are asked to vote if a review is ""Helpful"" or ""Unhelpful"" and the most positively voted reviews are placed on the top of product review list. However, the accumulation of votes takes time for a review to be fully voted and newly published reviews are always listed at the bottom of the review list. This paper proposes a linear model to predict the helpfulness of online product reviews. Reviews can be quickly ranked and classified by our model and reviews that may help consumers better than others will be retrieved. We compare our model with several machine learning classification algorithms and our experimental results show that our approach effectively classifies online reviews. Also, we provide an evaluation measurement to judge the performance of the helpfulness modeling algorithm and the results show that the helpfulness scores predicted by our approach consistently follow the changing trend of the true helpfulness values.";supervised learningApplying probabilistic latent semantic analysis to multi-criteria recommender system;Y. Zhang et al.;2009;https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/1574514.1574517;Nowadays some recommender system researchers have already been engaging multi-criteria that model possible attributes of the item to generate the improved recommendations. However, the statistical machine learning methods successful in the single-rating recommender system have not been investigated in the context of multi-criteria ratings. In this paper, we propose two types of multi-criteria probabilistic latent semantic analysis algorithms extended from the single-rating version. First, the mixture of multi-variate Gaussian distribution is assumed to be the underlying distribution of multi-criteria ratings of each user. Second, we further assume the mixture of the linear Gaussian regression model as the underlying distribution of multi-criteria ratings of each user, inspired by the Bayesian network and linear regression. The experiment results on the Yahoo!Movies ratings data set show that the full multi-variate Gaussian model and the linear Gaussian regression model achieve a stable performance gain over other tested methods.;supervised learningReal-time clothes comparison based on multi-view vision;W. Zhang et al.;2008;https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSC.2008.4635727;In this paper, we present a clothing recognition system that augments clothes recommendation and fashion exploration using the intelligent multi-view vision technology of the responsive mirror, an implicitly controlled human-computer interaction system for clothes fitting rooms. The responsive mirror provides shoppers with real-time ldquoselfrdquo and ldquosocialrdquo clothes comparisons. The system recommends clothing that is ldquosimilarrdquo and ldquodifferentrdquo than the clothing that the person is trying on in the mirror. The goal of the research in this paper is to create a recommendation system that uses a definition of ldquosimilarrdquo and ldquodifferentrdquo that matches human perception. We address the social nature of the recognition problem by conducting a user study to identify the salient clothes factors that people use to determine clothes similarity. We describe the computer vision and machine learning techniques employed to recognize the factors that human eyes perceive in term of clothing similarity from frontal-view outfit images. We describe the key components of the motion-tracking and clothes-recognition systems and evaluate their performance by user study and experiments on a simulated clothes fitting image dataset. The approach and results presented here will benefit designers and developers of similar applications in the future.;supervised learningAn online Bayesian networks model for E-commercial personalized recommendation system;S.-Z. Zhang et al.;2007;https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370754;This paper presents an online personalized recommended model based Bayesian networks. The model adopts outline learning algorithm for structure and online learning algorithm for parameter. The online parameter learning realizes the online adjusting and correcting for model. The online algorithm is based on the theory of EM and introduces correcting functions to realize online EM. The experimentation shows that the algorithm in this paper is suitable for online learning of personalized recommended model and the model that is obtained by online EM has a higher precision than basic EM.;supervised learningA machine learning based trust evaluation framework for online social networks;K. Zhao & Pan;2015;https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom.2014.13;Trust in Online Social Networks is an increasing popular issue in the field of social computing. It has been widely used in scenarios such as e-commerce, friend recommendation and trust-based access control system. Several trust computing methods have been proposed from different perspectives, however, most of them just quantify certain trust related factors and integrate them into a trust value by setting a weight for each factor. On the one hand, the weight is difficult to select since the influence that each factor has on trust is uncertain. On the other hand, the trust values generated by these methods might not be in accordance with users' subjective judgements and they are not straightforward for users to understand. It is necessary for a trust evaluation method to provide accurate and intuitive trust levels for the social network users. Therefore, in this paper, trust evaluation is formalized as a classification problem and a novel approach utilizing machine learning method is presented. Firstly, the trust feature vector is constructed according to the trust related factors. Then by training with collected sample data which contains trust feature vectors and trust ratings, a trust classifier can be established. Based on this approach, a general trust evaluation framework is proposed for network-level trust evaluation. The experiments in real social networks verify the feasibility of our framework and show that the trained trust classifier has a relatively high predicting accuracy.;unsupervised learningE-commerce recommendation with personalized promotion;Q. Zhao et al.;2015;https://doi.org/10.1145/2792838.2800178;Most existing e-commerce recommender systems aim to recommend the right products to a consumer, assuming the properties of each product are fixed. However, some properties, including price discount, can be personalized to respond to each consumer's preference. This paper studies how to automatically set the price discount when recommending a product, in light of the fact that the price will often alter a consumer's purchase decision. The key to optimizing the discount is to predict consumer's willingness-to-pay (WTP), namely, the highest price a consumer is willing to pay for a product. Purchase data used by traditional e-commerce recommender systems provide points below or above the decision boundary. In this paper we collected training data to better predict the decision boundary. We implement a new e-commerce mechanism adapted from laboratory lottery and auction experiments that elicit a rational customer's exact WTP for a small subset of products, and use a machine learning algorithm to predict the customer's WTP for other products. The mechanism is implemented on our own e-commerce website that leverages Amazon's data and subjects recruited via Mechanical Turk. The experimental results suggest that this approach can help predict WTP, and boost consumer satisfaction as well as seller profit.;supervised learning
