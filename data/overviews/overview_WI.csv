13;People’s Interactions with Cognitive Assistants for Enhanced Performances;HICSS;2018;http://hdl.handle.net/10125/50092;When cognitive computing enabled smart computers are growing in our daily lives, there are not many studies that explain how people interact and utilize these solutions, and the impact of these smart machines to people’s performance to do things. In this paper, a theoretical framework for boosting people’s performance using cognitive assistants (CAs) was developed and explained using the data analysis from 15 interviews. The results show that people interaction with CAs enhance their levels of cognition and intelligence that help them to enhance their capabilities. Enhanced capabilities help people to enhance their performance.;Explanation;Interview
47;Examining Trust and Reliance in Collaborations between Humans and Automated Agents;HICSS;2018;http://hdl.handle.net/10125/49943;Human trust and reliance in artificial agents is critical to effective collaboration in mixed human computer teams. Understanding the conditions under which humans trust and rely upon automated agent recommendations is important as trust is one of the mechanisms that allow people to interact effectively with a variety of teammates. We conducted exploratory research to investigate how personality characteristics and uncertainty conditions affect human-machine interactions. Participants were asked to determine if two images depicted the same or different people, while simultaneously considering the recommendation of an automated agent. Results of this effort demonstrated a correlation between judgements of agent expertise and user trust. In addition, we found that in conditions of high and low uncertainty, the decision outcomes of participants moved significantly in the direction of the agent’s recommendation. Differences in reported trust in the agent were observed in individuals with low and high levels of extraversion.;Explanation;Laboratory experiment
4;Towards Designing Cooperative and Social Conversational Agents for Customer Service;ICIS;2017;https://aisel.aisnet.org/icis2017/HCI/Presentations/1/;The idea of interacting with computers through natural language dates back to the 1960s, but recent technological advances have led to a renewed interest in conversational agents such as chatbots or digital assistants. In the customer service context, conversational agents promise to create a fast, convenient, and cost-effective channel for communicating with customers. Although numerous agents have been implemented in the past, most of them could not meet the expectations and disappeared. In this paper, we present our design science research project on how to design cooperative and social conversational agents to increase service quality in customer service. We discuss several issues that hinder the success of current conversational agents in customer service. Drawing on the cooperative principle of conversation and social response theory, we propose preliminary meta-requirements and design principles for cooperative and social conversational agents. Next, we will develop a prototype based on these design principles.;Design and Action;Literature analysis
48;AI capabilities and user experiences: a comparative study of user reviews for assistant and non-assistant mobile apps;AMCIS;2017;https://aisel.aisnet.org/amcis2017/SemanticsIS/Presentations/5/;Inspired by the progress in the field of artificial intelligence and by the assimilation of AI capabilities into a variety of IT applications, including personal assistant apps such as Siri, this study examines how user experiences with such assistant apps differs from their interactions with more traditional IT artifacts. Using text analysis of user reviews of 10 assistant and 15 non-assistant apps, we identify 50 topics that reflect user experiences and evaluations. Most identified topics map well into existing IS constructs, such as ease of use, system quality and affordances, suggesting that current IS theory adequately reflects user experiences with IT, and is relevant to the analysis of AI-enabled applications. The results also highlight differences in how users experience their interactions with assistant and non-assistant apps, pointing towards potential shifts in how we experience and theorize user-IT interactions in the AI-enabled world.;Analysis;Secondary data
41;Embodied Conversational Agent-Based Kiosk for Automated Interviewing;JMIS;2011;https://www.jstor.org/stable/41304605;We have created an automated kiosk that uses embodied intelligent agents to interview individuals and detect changes in arousal, behavior, and cognitive effort by using psychophysiological information systems. In this paper, we describe the system and propose a unique class of intelligent agents, which are described as Special Purpose Embodied Conversational Intelligence with Environmental Sensors (SPECIES). SPECIES agents use heterogeneous sensors to detect human physiology and behavior during interactions, and they affect their environment by influencing human behavior using various embodied states (i. e., gender and demeanor), messages, and recommendations. Based on the SPECIES paradigm, we present three studies that evaluate different portions of the model, and these studies are used as foundational research for the development of the automated kiosk. The first study evaluates human-computer interaction and how SPECIES agents can change perceptions of information systems by varying appearance and demeanor. Instantiations that had the agents embodied as males were perceived as more powerful, while female embodied agents were perceived as more likable. Similarly, smiling agents were perceived as more likable than neutral demeanor agents. The second study demonstrated that a single sensor measuring vocal pitch provides SPECIES with environmental awareness of human stress and deception. The final study ties the first two studies together and demonstrates an avatar-based kiosk that asks questions and measures the responses using vocalic measurements.;Design and Action;Laboratory experiment
49;Evaluating Anthropomorphic Product Recommendation Agents: A Social Relationship Perspective to Designing Information Systems;JMIS;2009;https://www.jstor.org/stable/40398956;In online shopping environments, the product-advising function originally performed by salespeople is being increasingly taken over by software-based product recommendation agents (PRAs). However, the literature has mostly focused on the functionality design and utilitarian value of such decision support systems, mostly ignoring the potential social influence they could exert on their users. The objective of this study is to apply a social relationship perspective to the design of interfaces for PRAs. We investigate the effects of applying anthropomorphic interfaces—namely, humanoid embodiment and voice output—on users' perceived social relationship with a technological and software-based artifact designed for electronic commerce contexts. The findings from a laboratory experiment indicate that using humanoid embodiment and human voice-based communication significantly influences users' perceptions of social presence, which in turn enhances users' trusting beliefs, perceptions of enjoyment, and ultimately, their intentions to use the agent as a decision aid. These results extend the applicability of theories concerning traditional shopper-salesperson relationships to customers' interactions with technological artifacts residing on Web sites—that is, the recommendation agent software—and provide practitioners with guidelines on how to design Internet stores with the goal of building social relationships with online shoppers and enhancing their overall shopping experiences.;Design and Action;Laboratory experiment
50;Intelligent Agents and Information Resource Management;AMCIS;2004;https://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2152&context=amcis2004;For twenty years, the field of artificial intelligence promised success in developing digital assistants, known as intelligent agents, to aid in all types of mundane and repetitive tasks. Unfortunately, few intelligent agents evolve to collect critical concurrence that artificial intelligence can deliver. This study recaps the advancement of technology in business applications enabling intelligent agent adaptation and describes the methodology available to intelligent agents to perform tasks within environments containing uncertainty, similar to the modern business environment. Intelligent agent applications and case examples in this investigation provide current solutions to assist in information resource management. This investigation indicates that intelligent agent technology is active in the modern business enterprise and offers practical IT solutions in meeting the challenge of effective information resource management.;Analysis;Speculation or commentary
51;Conversational Assistants: Investigating Privacy Concerns, Trust, and Self-Disclosure;ICIS;2017;https://aisel.aisnet.org/icis2017/Security/Presentations/19/;"By the end of 2017 more than 33 million voice-based devices will be in circulation, many of which  will include conversational assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri. These devices  require a significant amount of personal information from users to learn their preferences and  provide them with personalized responses. This creates an interesting and important tension: the  more information users disclose, the greater the value they receive from these devices; however,  due to concerns for the privacy of personal information, users tend to disclose less information.  In this study, we examine the role of reciprocal self-disclosure and trust within the novel and  emerging context of conversational assistants. Specifically, we investigate the effect of  conversational assistants’ self-disclosure on the relationship between users’ privacy concerns and  their self-disclosure. Further, we explore the mechanism through which self-disclosure by  conversational assistants influences this relationship, namely, the role of cognitive trust and  emotional trust.

11;Trusting in Machines: How Mode of Interaction Affects Willingness to Share Personal Information with Machines;HICSS;2018;http://hdl.handle.net/10125/49948;Every day, people make decisions about whether to trust machines with their personal information, such as letting a phone track one’s location. How do people decide whether to trust a machine? In a field experiment, we tested how two modes of interaction-”expression modality, whether the person is talking or typing to a machine, and response modality, whether the machine is talking or typing back-”influence the willingness to trust a machine. Based on research that expressing oneself verbally reduces self-control compared to nonverbal expression, we predicted that talking to a machine might make people more willing to share their personal information. Based on research on the link between anthropomorphism and trust, we further predicted that machines who talked (versus texted) would seem more human-like and be trusted more. Using a popular chatterbot phone application, we randomly assigned over 300 community members to either talk or type to the phone, which either talked or typed in return. We then measured how much participants anthropomorphized the machine and their willingness to share their personal information (e.g., their location, credit card information) with it. Results revealed that talking made people more willing to share their personal information than texting, and this was robust to participants’ self-reported comfort with technology, age, gender, and conversation characteristics. But listening to the application’s voice did not affect anthropomorphism or trust compared to reading its text. We conclude by considering the theoretical and practical implications of this experiment for understanding how people trust machines.;Explanation;Laboratory experiment
12;Facilitating Natural Conversational Agent Interactions: Lessons from a Deception Experiment;ICIS;2014;https://aisel.aisnet.org/icis2014/proceedings/HCI/9/;This study reports the results of a laboratory experiment exploring interactions between humans and a conversational agent. Using the ChatScript language, we created a chat bot that asked participants to describe a series of images. The two objectives of this study were (1) to analyze the impact of dynamic responses on participants’ perceptions of the conversational agent, and (2) to explore behavioral changes in interactions with the chat bot (i.e. response latency and pauses) when participants engaged in deception. We discovered that a chat bot that provides adaptive responses based on the participant’s input dramatically increases the perceived humanness and engagement of the conversational agent. Deceivers interacting with a dynamic chat bot exhibited consistent response latencies and pause lengths while deceivers with a static chat bot exhibited longer response latencies and pause lengths. These results give new insights on social interactions with computer agents during truthful and deceptive interactions.;Explanation;Laboratory experiment
26;The Influence of Conversational Agents on Socially Desirable Responding;HICSS;2018;http://hdl.handle.net/10125/49925;Conversational agents (CAs) are becoming an increasingly common component in many information systems. The ubiquity of CAs in cell phones, entertainment systems, and messaging applications has led to a growing need to understand how design choices made when developing CAs influence user interactions. In this study, we explore the use case of CAs that gather potentially sensitive information from people—for example, in a medical interview. Using a laboratory experiment, we examine the influence of CA responsiveness and embodiment on the answers people give in response to sensitive and non-sensitive questions. The results show that for sensitive questions, the responsiveness of the CA increased the social desirability of the responses given by participants. ;Explanation;Laboratory experiment
25;Interactive Realistic Digital Avatars - Revisiting the Uncanny Valley;HICSS;2017;http://hdl.handle.net/10125/41216;The 40-year-old Uncanny Valley theory is influential in the discussion surrounding acceptance of realistic graphical agents. This theory was formulated by observing robots. While it has been shown to be valid when observing digital characters, little has been studied about acceptance when people interact with avatars, rather than simply observe a recording. The emerging technology that will soon be able to create realistic avatars challenges the conventional view built on this theory, that affinity is a function of ‘appearance’, necessitating a reevaluation of the dimensions of the problem. We introduce a broader theoretical foundation with an additional dimension, namely interactivity. Studies that have validated the Uncanny Valley used still images or clips from existing media, but did not explore interactivity. In this study we suggest that interactivity operates on an independent, orthogonal dimension to ‘appearance’, and that interaction can ‘overcome the valley’ in affinity due to matching and common human non-verbal cues. We hypothesize that these cause the user to process the avatar differently. We contribute to the literature a new way to theorize the relationship between avatar realism and affinity, including both avatar appearance and interaction, and outline a research design to study this relationship.;Explanation;Laboratory experiment
52;Intelligent Virtual Assistant for Gamified Environments;PACIS;2016;https://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1384&context=pacis2016;Gamification aims at improving people's motivation and performance in certain tasks by introducing different mechanics taken from traditional games. Gamification has been successfully applied in different domains, such as education, marketing, and the workplace. In this paper we present an intelligent virtual assistant for gamified environments. This assistant will provide the players with help on the tasks they have to complete using natural language dialogues. The intelligent virtual assistant includes other advances technologies, such as sentiment analysis, and player's profile and interaction network analysis. This allows the assistant to analyze the sentiment polarity of each message submitted by the user, and to adapt its dialogues accordingly. It also allows the assistant to have knowledge about each player, including basic personal data and their social network. This allows the assistant to use those data in the dialogues to, for example, suggest players to ask for help to their friends, or even to suggest new friends to a player. We also present a case study in which the intelligent virtual assistant has been introduced in the gamified environment of a real company.;Design and Action;Case study
29;A NATURAL LANGUAGE-BASED MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM FOR LEGAL RESEARCH;AMCIS;2001;https://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1522&context=amcis2001&httpsredir=1&referer=;Conducting legal research can be a complex task for seasoned attorneys, and is even more daunting for laypeople. The proliferation of online legal resources requires sorting through the mass of information to obtain the most relevant and meaningful information. Various search techniques can be used on the Internet to narrow and refine one’s search, but the syntax required to search online sources varies. An intelligent agent system could be used to ease the search process by reformulating natural language queries into the appropriate syntax to launch a comprehensive search of relevant online sources to obtain the pertinent information. This paper discusses the benefits to be gained by the use of such an intelligent agent and proposes an architecture for a multi-agent system that implements a natural language based approach for query processing, in conjunction with a domain ontology.;Design and Action;Case study
8;A Nice and Friendly Chat with a Bot: User Perceptions of AI-Based Service Agents;ICIS;2017;https://aisel.aisnet.org/icis2017/ServiceScience/Presentations/11/;As more organizations establish artificial intelligence-based service agents to offer an automated customer dialogue it is crucial to understand how users perceive this new form of technology-mediated communication. AI-based service agents interact in a similar way as humans in human-to-human chat conversations, but instead of a live person on the other end, a chat bot steers the communication based on artificial intelligence and Natural Language Interaction. By combining qualitative and quantitative methods, we examine this context and explore the role of perceived authenticity and its impact on users’ attitudinal and behavioral outcomes. Our results from the qualitative studies show that users infer the authenticity of the AI-based service agents based on two different categories of cues: (1) agent-related cues and (2) communication-related cues. We employ additional experimental studies to empirically test antecedents and consequences of authenticity perceptions in AI-based service encounters.;Explanation;Interview
53;Natural Language Interface for a Multi Agent System;AMCIS;2004;https://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1791&context=amcis2004;This paper presents the natural language interface for an agent-based system, called MACS (Multi-Agent Contracting System). The MACS system is designed to provide advice in the pre-award phase of a defense contract. The original version of MACS allowed the users to query using only a list of predetermined keywords using pull-down menus. The second version of MACS incorporated a natural language interface in order to increase its usability. This study further enhances the natural language interface of MACS with a more robust parser. The paper presents the overall architecture of MACS and the parser used to further enhance the natural language interface.;Design and Action;Laboratory experiment
54;An Investigation of Conversational Agent Relevance, Presence, and Engagement;AMCIS;2018;https://aisel.aisnet.org/amcis2018/HCI/Presentations/12/;Conversational agents (CAs) are becoming an integral component of many personal and business interactions. Despite the prevalence of CAs in modern life, there are many factors related to the social nature of the interaction between CAs and humans that remain uninvestigated. This research uses Social Presence Theory to examine the effect of CA conversational relevance on perceptions of humanness and engagement. We performed a laboratory experiment in which participants interacted with a CA that gave either conversationally relevant or nonrelevant responses. Our results indicate that people perceive CAs that give conversationally relevant responses to be more humanlike and more socially present, ultimately leading to higher engagement than CAs that give nonrelevant responses.;Explanation;Laboratory experiment
55;Faster Is Not Always Better: Understanding the Effect of Dynamic Response Delays in Human-Chatbot Interaction;ECIS;2018;https://aisel.aisnet.org/ecis2018_rp/113/;A key challenge in designing conversational user interfaces is to make the conversation between the user and the system feel natural and human-like. In order to increase perceived humanness, many systems with conversational user interfaces (e.g., chatbots) use response delays to simu-late the time it would take humans to respond to a message. However, delayed responses may also negatively impact user satisfaction, particularly in situations where fast response times are expected, such as in customer service. This paper reports the findings of an online experiment in a customer service context that investigates how user perceptions differ when interacting with a chatbot that sends dynamically delayed responses compared to a chatbot that sends near-instant responses. The dynamic delay length was calculated based on the complexity of the re-sponse and complexity of the previous message. Our results indicate that dynamic response de-lays not only increase users’ perception of humanness and social presence, but also lead to greater satisfaction with the overall chatbot interaction. Building on social response theory, we provide evidence that a chatbot’s response time represents a social cue that triggers social re-sponses shaped by social expectations. Our findings support researchers and practitioners in understanding and designing more natural human-chatbot interactions.;Design and Action;Laboratory experiment
38;Designing Anthropomorphic Conversational Agents: Development and Empirical Evaluation of a Design Framework;ICIS;2018;https://aisel.aisnet.org/icis2018/hcri/Presentations/1/;Conversational agents (CA) interact in natural language. This emulation of human-to-human communication represents the distinct characteristic of CAs and makes research on CAs inseparable from questions regarding anthropomorphism – the attribution of human qualities to non-human agents. Consequently, meaningful research on CA design, perception and use, requires knowledge on how to control the degree of anthropomor- phism when designing CAs. Therefore, we develop a framework for the design of anthropomorphic CAs. Based on psychological theory of anthropomorphism and related studies on interface design, we identify three anthropomorphic design dimensions: human identity, non-verbal and verbal. Our empirical evaluation provides support for the relevance of these dimensions, but also reveals counterintuitive results. In particular, we find that the consideration of more anthropomorphic design dimensions does not necessarily increase anthropomorphism and some designs can even manifest a negative influence on anthropomorphism. We discuss our findings in detail and illustrate their relevance for research and practice.;Design and Action;Framework

Using a 2 x 2 experimental design, with the humanoid service robot Pepper and a human frontline employee enacting innovative service conditions, the predicted effects on customer responses were examined. Customers responded generally positive on innovative service behavior cues and there were no significant differences in customer responses comparing human-robot interaction to human-human interaction. Furthermore, this study discovered discrepancies between expected and perceived innovative service behavior of the robot. A polynomial regression and a response surface analysis model were computed to examine the effects of this discrepancy on customer responses.;Design and Action;Framework
57;Alexa, Buy Me a Movie!: How AI Speakers Reshape Digital Content Consumption and Preference;ICIS;2018;https://aisel.aisnet.org/icis2018/economics/Presentations/9/;Technologies based on artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized how individuals use various services by enabling verbal command over machines. Although such alternative forms of human-machine interaction have begun to insinuate themselves into our lives, limited efforts have been directed toward examining their economic effects. This study takes off from the current state of scholarship by examining the effects of AI speaker usage on consumers’ content consumption and preference behaviors. To this end, we used the dual processing system and self-control dilemma frameworks to analyze a unique panel data set that comprises information on household patterns of digital content transaction, consumption, and AI usage. Our results indicate that the adoption of AI speakers is positively associated with increased digital content purchase but negatively related to the average rate of content completion. We also find a change in type of content purchased, with customers consuming a greater proportion of hedonic products. The findings on households’ AI usage patterns indicate that emotion-seeking interactions are more positively associated with purchase than information-seeking interactions. On the basis of our findings, we drew implications for the design of optimal voice commerce strategies and derive insights into effectively eliciting the economic value of the voice recognition market.;Explanation;Secondary data

We refer to such systems as AI-enabled systems. User interaction with these systems is an important topic for information systems (IS) research because they are supposed to bring about substantial change for individuals, organizations, and society. Despite the recent public and academic interest in AI, AI-enabled systems are not a new phenomenon. However, previous research is separated into research streams on different AI-enabled system types. We conducted a literature review to aggregate the dispersed knowledge regarding individual user interaction with such systems in IS research. Our results show common behavioral patterns in interactions between users and various types of AI-enabled systems and provide a solid foundation for future research on this topic.;Explanation;Literature analysis

Dialogs used in sales talks are governed by complex and in many respects conflicting intentions on both sides. While previous Decision Support Systems (DSS) are designed by the principle of congruent intentions of communication partners, we present an approach that extends this by congruent and opposing intentions of communication partners. We use a design methodology for dialog-based purchase DSS that use Natural Language Technologies (NLT) for dynamically creating question-answer-based sales dialogs. It is first shown how dialog schemata are obtained by a field study and evaluated by subjects. In the second part, these schemata are integrated in a Natural Language Technology-enhanced Mobile Sales Assistant (NLT-MSA). The role of NLT-MSA is to take the position of a sales person with the task to balance congruent and conflicting intentions during sales dialogs. Results of a lab experiment (n=54) are discussed by which the use of a NLT-MSA prototype in sales situations were tested.

In this short paper, we aim to provide insights in the current state of literature in this area and derive a definition for Enterprise Bots that is reusable by scholars and practitioners. Furthermore, we propose a research model based on the decomposed Theory of Planned Behavior, that both validates this definition and allows further insights into the topic of Enterprise Bots. Finally, we conclude by testing this model in a survey at a multi-national company and find that 10 of 12 used constructs are highly reliable.;Explanation;Literature analysis

Popular examples are Siri, Alexa, Cortana and Google Assistant. The use of IVA on technology devices significantly change how users interact with search systems and other online services. Despite the proliferation of IVA in the U.S. and other western countries, there is limited research on the theoretical foundations of service quality as related to IVA platforms. We address this gap in the extant IS literature. This study aims to advance academic literature on how dimensions of IVA encounter could mediate between the service quality of online services and the resulting user service satisfaction and service loyalty. By understanding the different dimensions of IVA encounter, online service providers should be able to leverage the IVA benefits in their service content and delivery design to enhance the service quality delivered to their customers.;Explanation;Framework
62;Virtual Moderation Assistance: Creating Design Guidelines for Virtual Assistants Supporting Creative Workshops;PACIS;2018;https://aisel.aisnet.org/pacis2018/80/;To remain competitive, businesses need to develop innovative and profitable products, processes and services. The development of innovation relies on novel ideas, which can be generated during creative workshops. In this context the Design Thinking approach, a problem-solving methodology based on collaboration, user-centricity and creativity, may be used. However, guidance and moderation of this process require a vast amount of skills and knowledge. As technologies like artificial intelligence have the potential of making machines our collaboration partner in the future, creating virtual assistants adapting human behaviors is promising. To reduce cognitive dissonance and stress on both the moderators and participants, we investigate the potential of a virtual assistant to support moderation in a Design Thinking process to improve innovative output as well as perceived satisfaction. We therefore developed design guidelines for virtual assistants supporting creative workshops based on qualitative expert interviews and related literature following the Design Science Research Methodology.;Design and Action;Interview

We first analyze the topic of Siri usage discussion from Zhihu's Q&A website, and then propose a theoretical model which hypothesized that discontinuous usage of Voice-Activated IPAs are affected by perceived ambiguity, cognitive overload, privacy concern, social embarrassment and lack of integration. It is hypothesized that perceived ambiguity will exert nonlinear impacts on discontinuous usage. Meanwhile, perceived ambiguity is also affected by level of personification in a nonlinear way. Scale development and data collection would be conducted for the future work. It is expected that the results our research could provide theoretical and practical implications for the design of Voice-Activated IPAs.;Explanation;Secondary data
64;Alexa, Tell Me More: The Effect of Advertisements on Memory Accuracy from Smart Speakers;PACIS;2018;https://aisel.aisnet.org/pacis2018/204/;The smart speaker is currently one of the fastest-growing consumer technologies. As a result, more and more people are buying products through smart speakers. However, because voice commerce advertisements are not yet active, little is known about the effectiveness of smart speaker advertisements. This study assessed advertisement effectiveness using several distinctive features of the smart speaker: interactivity, contextually relevant advertisements, and voice changes. Study 1 illustrates that when users interact with an advertisement from the speaker, the effects of the advertisements are more significant than the effects of one-way advertisements, especially in the case of low involvement products. Study 2 further illustrated that contextually relevant advertisements increase the advertisement effectiveness from the smart speaker, while voice dissimilarity moderates the relationship between the contextual relevance and the effectiveness. These findings provide future directions for producing the new forms of advertisements and verifying advertisement effectiveness in the smart speaker environment.;Explanation;Laboratory experiment

These agents assist customers in reducing information overload, providing advice to find suitable products, and facilitating online decision-making. Consumer trust in recommendation agents is an integral factor influencing their successful adoption. However, the nature of trust in technological artifacts is still an under-investigated and not well understood topic. Online recommendation agents work on behalf of individual users (principals) by reflecting their specific needs and preferences. Trust issues associated with online recommendation agents are complicated. Users may be concerned about the competence of an agent to satisfy their needs as well as its integrity and benevolence in regard to acting on their behalf rather than on behalf of a web merchant or a manufacture. This study extends the interpersonal trust construct to trust in online recommendation agents and examines the nomological validity of trust in agents by testing an integrated Trust-TAM (Technology Acceptance Model). The results from a laboratory experiment confirm the nomological validity of trust in online recommendation agents. Consumers treat online recommendation agents as "" social actors"" and perceive human characteristics (e.g., benevolence and integrity) in computerized agents. Furthermore, the results confirm the validity of Trust-TAM to explain online recommendation acceptance and reveal the relative importance of consumers' initial trust vis-¨¤-vis other antecedents addressed by TAM (i.e. perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use). Both the usefulness of the agents as ""tools"" and consumers' trust in the agents as ""virtual assistants"" are important in consumers' intentions to adopt online recommendation agents.";Explanation;Laboratory experiment
67;Attributions of Trust in Decision Support Technologies: A Study of Recommendation Agents for E-Commerce;JMIS;2008;https://www.jstor.org/stable/40398919;As organizations increasingly utilize Web-based technologies to support customers better, trust in decision support technologies has emerged as an important issue in online environments. In this study, we identify six reasons users trust (or do not trust) a technology in the early stages of its use by extending the theories of trust formation in interpersonal and organizational contexts to that of decision support technologies. We study the particular context of decision support technologies for e-commerce: online recommendation agents (RAs), which facilitate users' decision making by providing advice on what to buy based on user-specified needs and preferences. A laboratory experiment is conducted using a multimethod approach to collect data. Both quantitative data about participants' trust in RAs and written protocols that explain the reasons for their levels of trust are collected. A content analysis of the written protocols identifies both positive and negative trust attributions that are then mapped to six trust reasons. A structural equation modeling analysis is employed to test the causal strengths of the trust reasons in explaining participants' trust in RAs. The results reveal that in the early stages of trust formation, four positive reasons (i.e., knowledge-based, interactive, calculative, and dispositional) are associated with higher trust in RAs and two negative reasons (i.e., calculative and interactive) are associated with lower trust in RAs. The results also demonstrate some distinctive features of trust formation with respect to decision support technologies. We discuss the research and practical implications of the findings and describe opportunities for future research.;Explanation;Laboratory experiment
21;The Role of Design Characteristics in Shaping Perceptions of Similarity: The Case of Online Shopping Assistants;JAIS;2006;https://aisel.aisnet.org/jais/vol7/iss12/34/;This research proposes that technological artifacts are perceived as social actors, and that users can attribute personality and behavioral traits to them. These formed perceptions interact with the user’s own characteristics to construct an evaluation of the similarity between the user and the technological artifact. Such perceptions of similarity are important because individuals tend to more positively evaluate others, in this case technological artifacts, to whom they are more similar. Using an automated shopping assistant as one type of technological artifact, we investigate two types of perceived similarity between the customer and the artifact: perceived personality similarity and perceived behavioral similarity. We then investigate how design characteristics drive a customer’s perceptions of these similarities and, importantly, the bases for those design characteristics. Decisional guidance and speech act theory provide the basis for personality manifestation, while normative versus heuristic-based decision rules provide the basis for behavioral manifestation. We apply these design bases in an experiment. The results demonstrate that IT design characteristics can be used to manifest desired personalities and behaviors in a technological artifact. Moreover, these manifestations of personality and behavior interact with the customer’s own personality and behaviors to create matching perceptions of personality and behavioral similarity between the customer and the artifact. This study emphasizes the need to consider technological artifacts as social actors and describes the specific ways in which technology design can manifest social attributes. In doing so, we show that it is possible to match the social attributes of a technological artifact with those of the user.;Explanation;Field experiment
68;Agents and E-commerce : Beyond Automation Full Paper;AMCIS;2015;https://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1220&context=amcis2015&httpsredir=1&referer=;The fast-growing information and communication technologies have shifted the contemporary commerce in both its information and market spaces. Businesses demand a new generation of agile and adaptive commerce systems. Towards this end, software agents, a type of autonomous artifacts, have been viewed as a promising solution. They have been taking an increasingly important part in facilitating e-commerce operations in the last two decades. This article presents a systematized overview of the diversity of agent applications in commerce. The paper argues that agents start playing more substantial role in determining social affairs. They also have a strong potential to be used to build the future highly responsive and smart e-commerce systems. The opportunities and challenges presented by proliferation of agent technologies in e-commerce necessitate the development of insights into their place in information systems research, as well as practical implications for the management. ;Analysis;Speculation or commentary
